   Theme: cultural heritage, territorial impact, indicators, monitoring
   and evaluation
--
   The service shall attempt to quantify the contribution (impact) of
   material cultural heritage to economical development in the stakeholder
   countries and regions over the past 5 years. Building on the work done
   by the European Heritage Heads Forum’s Economic Task Force and the
   European Commission, this research activity will define a list of
   economic sectors on which the material cultural heritage has an impact
   and perform data collection on the selected impact indicators.
--
   The main outcome should be a common theoretical framework, defining the
   most important economic sectors on which the material cultural heritage
   has an impact and developing the empirical evidence of such impact.
--
   This study is named as one of the key studies by the “European
   Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage” (adopted by the European
   Commission in December 2018). Economic statistics and indicators
   produced will be useful for understanding the economic contribution of
   the material cultural heritage. Overall the results will promote
   evidence-based decision making related to protection and promotion of
   material cultural heritage.
