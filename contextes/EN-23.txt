   Cultural heritage is the heritage of tangible and intangible heritage
   assets of a group or society that is inherited from past generations.
   Not all heritages of past generations are "heritage"; rather, heritage
   is a product of selection by society.^[1]

   Cultural heritage includes tangible culture (such as buildings,
   monuments, landscapes, archive materials, books, works of art, and
   artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language,
   and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant
   landscapes, and biodiversity).^[2] The term is often used in connection

   particular culture, more often maintained by social customs during a

   intangible cultural heritage is more difficult to preserve than

   "Natural heritage" is also an important part of a society's heritage,
   encompassing the countryside and natural environment, including flora
--
   elements (including mineralogical, geomorphological, paleontological,
   etc.), scientifically known as geodiversity. These kind of heritage
   sites often serve as an important component in a country's tourist
   industry, attracting many visitors from abroad as well as locally.
   Heritage can also include cultural landscapes (natural features that
   may have cultural attributes).

   Aspects of the preservation and conservation of natural heritage
   include:
