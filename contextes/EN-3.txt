IUCN's work on World Heritage

   IUCN strives to enhance the role of the World Heritage Convention in
   protecting the planet’s biodiversity and promote effective use of its
--
   sites. IUCN's approach to conserving the natural sites inscribed on the
   UNESCO World Heritage List is based on decades of work, expertise and
   partnerships. IUCN is an official advisor to the World Heritage
   Committee. In addition to this statutory role, IUCN assesses the
   conservation prospects of all natural sites through the IUCN World
   Heritage Outlook. IUCN also implements capacity-building initiatives
   through the World Heritage Leadership programme, recognising the
   connections between People-Nature-Culture in managing World Heritage
   sites.

Why is natural World Heritage important?

   World Heritage sites enjoy the highest level of international
   recognition through the 1972 World Heritage Convention, as places so
   valuable that their conservation transcends boundaries, cultures and
   generations. Our ability to secure the highest quality of protection to
   natural World Heritage sites is therefore a litmus test of the
   effectiveness of nature conservation more broadly.

   Although there are relatively few natural World Heritage sites compared
   to other types of protected areas, they cover very large areas that
   represent the best of nature. The 257 sites currently inscribed on the
   World Heritage List for their natural values cover about 7.4% of the
   world’s total protected lands and seas.

   Natural World Heritage sites include iconic places such as the
   Galapagos Islands, the Serengeti, Kilimanjaro, Yellowstone, the Great
