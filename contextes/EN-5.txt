   presentation highlighted the preliminary findings of the research
   project on “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in Heritage.”
   Ordered by the newly founded Stichting Next Gen Heritage, the project

   implications of ageing of many professionals active in heritage, and
   the Faro Convention.

   This presentation at the Dutch National Monuments Conference shed light
   on the crucial need for the heritage sector to adapt and evolve,
   embracing the talents and energies of young professionals. The findings
   from “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in Heritage” set the stage
   for future developments and strategic changes in the sector.

   The research, which is a part of the broader initiative by the
   Stichting Next Generation Heritage focuses on three critical aspects:
    1. Labor Market Overview: The first part of the presentation detailed

       Thus heritage workers, especially those who work in the public
       sector, increasingly spend their time in multidisciplinary

       the findings related to higher education students in heritage
       fields. It showed students have a very strong commitment to
       heritage, and is coupled to their active engagement with societal
       issues close to them, ranging from climate change, housing

       sector, there’s a clear disconnect between these young aspirants
       and the current state of the heritage sector. Students often
       perceive a lack of visible job opportunities, internships, and

       In the same vein, the ideal work environment as defined by young
       professionals in the heritage sector, is characterized by small and
       agile organizations. These organizations are prized for their

    4. Sector’s Current State and Challenges: The final part of the
       presentation addressed how the heritage sector has been operating.

   Implications and Future Directions

   Concluding the presentation, foundation director Herbert-Jan Hiep
   invited stakeholders in the heritage sector from government, industry
   and educational backgrounds, to collaborate with the Stichting Next
   Generation Heritage to create pilot projects. These should explore new
   forms of multidisciplinary and intergeneration cooperation within a
   learning-on-the-job-type environment. The foundation aims to create a
   heritage sector that is innovative, inclusive, and aligned with the
   interests of the next generation, ensuring its vitality and relevance
