2.8. Big Data and Cultural Heritage

   The new “trends” in technology usually affect the research branches
   that are attached to it, and so, cultural heritage is examined from the
   perspective of big data. Big data usually derive from social media,

   trend of personas. Another interesting sector of culture and cultural
   heritage is games. The authors in [103] explain an algorithm for user
   clustering in cultural games. Intangible cultural heritage and the
   analysis on social media is the main theme of [104]. Specifically, the
   authors analyse the Transmission of the Feminist Intangible Cultural
   Heritage on Twitter. The perspective of multi-faceted analytics in the
   cultural heritage domain is researched in [105]. The authors present a
   data lake that offers both fundamental and advanced user and

   Many recent works try to tackle problems related to culture, cultural
