Why is natural World heritage important?

   World heritage sites enjoy the highest level of international
   recognition through the 1972 World heritage Convention, as places so
   valuable that their conservation transcends boundaries, cultures and
   generations. Our ability to secure the highest quality of protection to
   natural World heritage sites is therefore a litmus test of the
   effectiveness of nature conservation more broadly.

   Although there are relatively few natural World heritage sites compared
   to other types of protected areas, they cover very large areas that
   represent the best of nature. The 257 sites currently inscribed on the
   World heritage List for their natural values cover about 7.4% of the
   world’s total protected lands and seas.

   Natural World heritage sites include iconic places such as the
   Galapagos Islands, the Serengeti, Kilimanjaro, Yellowstone, the Great

Chances and ambitions: the future of young talent in heritage

--
   presentation highlighted the preliminary findings of the research
   project on “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in heritage.”
   Ordered by the newly founded Stichting Next Gen heritage, the project
   aims to explore the integration of young professionals into the Dutch
   heritage sector, addressing contemporary challenges such as the
   implications of ageing of many professionals active in heritage, and
   the Faro Convention.
--
   This presentation at the Dutch National Monuments Conference shed light
   on the crucial need for the heritage sector to adapt and evolve,
   embracing the talents and energies of young professionals. The findings
   from “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in heritage” set the stage
   for future developments and strategic changes in the sector.
--
   The research, which is a part of the broader initiative by the
   Stichting Next Generation heritage focuses on three critical aspects:
    1. Labor Market Overview: The first part of the presentation detailed
       the diverse nature of the heritage sector, including the
       differences in chains and organizational structures like in built
       and green heritage, archaeology, archives, and museums. Each
       segment has unique needs in education and faces different kinds of

       But the research also shows that, at least in the Netherlands,
       heritage is becoming a more and more integral part of bigger
       processes, like city planning or the battle against climate change.
       Thus heritage workers, especially those who work in the public
       sector, increasingly spend their time in multidisciplinary

    2. Youth Perspectives and Aspirations: The presentation zoomed into
       the findings related to higher education students in heritage
       fields. It showed students have a very strong commitment to

What is Cultural heritage?

--
   inches (Musée du Louvre)
   We often hear about the importance of cultural heritage. But what is
   cultural heritage? And whose heritage is it? Whose national heritage,
   for example, does the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci belong to? Is it
   French or Italian?
   First of all, let’s have a look at the meaning of the words. “heritage”
   is a property, something that is inherited, passed down from previous
   generations. In the case of “cultural heritage,” the heritage doesn’t
   consist of money or property, but of culture, values, and traditions.
   Cultural heritage implies a shared bond, our belonging to a community.
   It represents our history and our identity; our bond to the past, to
--

Tangible and intangible cultural heritage

   Cultural heritage often brings to mind artifacts (paintings, drawings,
   prints, mosaics, sculptures), historical monuments and buildings, as
   well as archaeological sites. But the concept of cultural heritage is
   even wider than that, and has gradually grown to include all evidence
--
   manuscripts, and instruments, etc. either as individual objects or as
   collections. Today, towns, underwater heritage, and the natural
   environment are also considered part of cultural heritage since
   communities identify themselves with the natural landscape.
   Moreover, cultural heritage is not only limited to material objects
   that we can see and touch. It also consists of immaterial elements:
--
   skills transmitted from generation to generation within a community.
   Intangible heritage, therefore, includes a dizzying array of
   traditions, music, and dances such as tango and flamenco, holy

The importance of protecting cultural heritage

   But cultural heritage is not just a set of cultural objects or
   traditions from the past. It is also the result of a selection process:
--
   All peoples make their contribution to the culture of the world. That’s
   why it’s important to respect and safeguard all cultural heritage,
   through national laws and international treaties. Illicit trafficking
--
   and destruction of historical buildings and monuments cause irreparable
   damage to the cultural heritage of a country. UNESCO (United Nations
   Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), founded in 1954,
   has adopted international conventions on the protection of cultural
   heritage, to foster intercultural understanding while stressing the
   importance of international cooperation.
   The protection of cultural property is an old problem. One of the most
   frequently recurring issues in protecting cultural heritage is the
   difficult relationship between the interests of the individual and the

   sixteenth century by Leonardo da Vinci, and displayed at the Musée du
   Louvre in Paris. From a modern point of view, whose national heritage
   does the Mona Lisa belong to?

   Leonardo was a very famous Italian painter, that’s why the Mona Lisa is
   obviously part of the Italian cultural heritage. When Leonardo went to
   France, to work at

   the royal collections: that’s why it is obviously part of the French
   national heritage, too. This painting has been defined as the best
   known, the most visited, the most written about, and the most parodied
   work of art in the world: as such, it belongs to the cultural heritage
   of all mankind.

            The way I see, Culture is a way of life. Or more accurately
            how you live your life. Cultural heritage is a way to catalog

            today. So yes cultural heritage is a form of history. But
            rather then focusing on dates and facts, cultural heritage
            focuses on intellectual and spiritual humanity.

   Cultural heritage is the heritage of tangible and intangible heritage
   assets of a group or society that is inherited from past generations.
   Not all heritages of past generations are "heritage"; rather, heritage
   is a product of selection by society.^[1]

   Cultural heritage includes tangible culture (such as buildings,
   monuments, landscapes, archive materials, books, works of art, and
   artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language,
   and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant
   landscapes, and biodiversity).^[2] The term is often used in connection

   "Intangible cultural heritage" consists of non-physical aspects of a

   "Natural heritage" is also an important part of a society's heritage,
   encompassing the countryside and natural environment, including flora

   elements (including mineralogical, geomorphological, paleontological,
   etc.), scientifically known as geodiversity. These kind of heritage
   sites often serve as an important component in a country's tourist
   industry, attracting many visitors from abroad as well as locally.

   The service shall attempt to quantify the contribution (impact) of
   material cultural heritage to economical development in the stakeholder
   countries and regions over the past 5 years. Building on the work done
   by the European heritage Heads Forum’s Economic Task Force and the

   This study is named as one of the key studies by the “European
   Framework for Action on Cultural heritage” (adopted by the European
   Commission in December 2018). Economic statistics and indicators
   produced will be useful for understanding the economic contribution of
   the material cultural heritage. Overall the results will promote

Defining culture, heritage and identity

--

   What is heritage and identity?

   Questions of heritage and identity are not as straightforward as they
   might first appear. Perhaps the first and best place to begin
   addressing these topics is by acknowledging that in a country like
   South Africa, there is not one heritage, or an easily delineated set of
   distinct identities. The cultures, languages and heritages of South
   Africa are multiple, diverse, and dynamic. Intersectional issues of

   heritage, culture, identity in South Africa and attempt to provide some
   overview of what is meant when people speak of South African heritage.

   Like 'heritage' and 'identity,' 'culture' is a term that causes much
   confusion and suffers from its misuse. Traditionally it has been used

   World heritage sites. They are respected and internationally protected
   against harm. Cultural heritage, on the other hand, can be an

   heritage' is used to describe those things that contribute to the sense
   of identity of a particular population or community of people. These

Key Difference – Ancestry vs heritage

   grandparents, and we are descendants of their ancestry. On the other
   hand, heritage is the inherited customs, traditions, beliefs,
   monuments, and artifacts from our ancestors. heritage includes both
   physical objects and intangible things. The key difference between
   ancestry and heritage is that the ancestry is the lineage of the people
   while the heritage is the inheritance from the ancestry. In this
   article, we are going to look at the difference between the terms,
   ancestry and heritage, in more detail.

   ancestry vs. heritage
   [INS: :INS]

What is heritage?

   heritage deals with cultural inheritance. Material things, as well as
   non-tangible things, can be inherited via culture. Whatever the things
   we inherit from our ancestors can be considered as heritage. Also,
   peoples’ lifestyles are shaped by heritage. That is, we form our
   behaviors according to the habits, lifestyles, ideas, beliefs, and
   practices, etc., inherited from our culture. heritage can be seen in
   many forms. Natural resources, such as fauna and flora,
   landscapes, land forms, etc. can be considered as natural heritages.
   Artifacts, paintings, jewelry, clothes, and monuments can be described
   as material heritages. Beliefs, values, traditions, ethics, and morals
   are non-physical features that we’ve  inherited. All these things add
   value to humans as a whole, and we all benefit from those heritages.

   An important fact about heritage is that it could be preserved and
   valued as well as it could be destroyed. We can leave our heritages to
   the future generations also if we want. However, heritage is an
   essential part of our current life.

Looking to the Future: Global Challenges to Cultural heritage Preservation

--
   After decades working to underscore, preserve, and rehabilitate key
   cultural heritage in countries around the world from Albania to
   Zimbabwe, our commitment to our planet’s monuments of cultural
   expression and human ingenuity is as strong as ever. We must, however,
   recognize that the global challenges facing the cultural heritage we
   endeavor to protect have changed and created a new landscape across

   protection because they have been sidelined for generations. These
   heritage places hold incredible importance for the communities that
   value them and often represent unique facets of human ingenuity,

   crucial path forward to recognizing and protecting humanity’s rich
   heritage. The most iconic historic places comprise countless unheard
   stories and unrecognized contributions by disenfranchised communities.

Cultural heritage “in Crisis”

--
   the news media as well as in academic journals on the theme of
   “cultural heritage in crisis.” You could say it’s a booming field.
   But how true is it?
   It’s certainly true that cultural heritage is in danger of destruction,
   looting, or illicit trafficking in many places around the world. It’s
   also true that new types of threats to cultural heritage have developed
   in the last few decades.
--

   Some regions—most recently the heritage-rich areas of the Middle
   East—have certainly experienced a marked increase in illicit
--
   But usage of the term “crisis” to describe the destruction of cultural
   heritage around the world is perhaps a misleading one. “Crisis” is a
   term that indicates a problem that has an urgent, yet temporary
   quality. However, the loss and destruction of cultural heritage is not
   new in human history and is not restricted by the duration of political
--
   United States, face a longstanding and ongoing struggle to protect
   heritage in the face of numerous challenges, regardless of political,
   social, or economic security. It may be worth considering that the idea
   of “crisis” deceptively frames the destruction of heritage as a product
   of temporary instabilities that cease to be a problem once conflicts
   are over. In reality, conditions of “crisis” only really provide new
   opportunities for heritage destruction processes that were already
   happening and will continue happening after the “crisis” is over.

Threats to cultural heritage: war

--
   are two types of threats:
     * destruction of heritage sites and objects caused by war, poverty,
       and development initiatives
--

   In wartime, destruction of heritage sites can be a result of collateral
   damage, for example, when a bomb targeting one location inadvertently
--
   caused by ISIS. However, the majority of damage to cities and to
   heritage has in fact not been caused by ISIS, but by the Syrian
   government’s campaign of relentless aerial bombardment, which has
   destroyed up to 70% of the fabric of the ancient city of Aleppo, a
   UNESCO World heritage site.
   Walter Hahn, Dresden: view of the destroyed inner city from the town
--
   manuscripts dating back to the 16th century. Deliberate or neglectful
   destruction of heritage has long been a key strategy of war, and
   perpetrators are rarely prosecuted for it.
   The long history of the destruction of heritage shows us that the
   elimination of culture has always been viewed as a powerful tool of
   domination and as a key strategy for eliminating the value humans
   accord to their lives. In recent years, the destruction of heritage —
   whether through war, commercial exploitation, and/or looting — has been
--
   erased. It is not surprising to note, therefore, that the destruction
   of heritage is often a precursor to genocide. This is because in
   denying people their past, perpetrators also deny them a future.

Threats to cultural heritage: development, climate change, tourism, and
natural disasters

   Nevertheless, wartime destruction of heritage is only a small fraction
   of the overall loss of cultural heritage around the world. Much more
   significant and long-lasting is destruction due to urban development,
--
   expand resource extraction on public lands in the United States is also
   causing widespread loss of heritage, as at the Bears Ears National
   Monument, which was controversially reduced by 85% in a decision signed

   Although many heritage sites are preserved in order to encourage
   tourist revenue, tourism can also cause massive destruction because of
--

   If destruction of heritage during wartime is akin to a relatively
   sudden death, looting is like a cancer that slowly erodes it. Looting
   is the theft of heritage items for sale on the antiquities market, most
   often to wealthy private buyers in the United States and Europe. As art
--
   Most importantly, it allows us to focus on the real driver of
   destruction: the demand in wealthy countries for heritage objects — a
   demand that ultimately fuels the entire antiquities trade — and the lax
--
   as that between art — largely considered to be a private commodity
   subject to market demand, versus heritage — which is typically framed
   as “universal” and the patrimony of all.
   Understanding that cultural heritage has been under threat for a very
   long time allows us to avoid short-term, crisis-based responses, and

       peoples are erased. It is not surprising to note, therefore, that
       the destruction of heritage is often a precursor to genocide. This
       is because in denying people their past, perpetrators also deny

       so, the destruction of heritage is certainly causing a psycological
       genocide where one fears any discussion.

       , but in this quest to save cultural heritage, aren't we fighting a
       losing battle? As long as people, who are the basis of everything,
       won't recognize the value of heritage either cultural or of any
       other kind, there would be no point trying to save it.</text>

     “heritage is all the inherited conditions, objects, places and

How can the loss of cultures and heritage from climate change be measured?

   One of the major themes of the conference was to discuss ways that
   powerful stories of heritage loss from climate change can be properly
   measured and tracked to give an idea of impacts at national,

   Doing this will be crucial to get policymakers to take the issue of

   Another important way to measure and track heritage loss from warming

   heritage as an example.

   Clarke told the conference that more must be done to include heritage
   in IPCC reports:

     “The [most recent IPCC climate impacts assessment] does not evenly
     or comprehensively incorporate heritage into its discussions around
     loss and damage, even though heritage is fundamental to all seven of
     its central chapters: terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; oceans

   IPCC climate impacts assessment, the chapter on Africa was the only one
   to prominently discuss the impact of climate change on heritage.

   Climate and Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town, who
   contributed to the research on world heritage sites in Africa at risk
   from sea level rise, several speakers noted. They added that more could
   be done to ensure heritage is more prominently featured in the next
   assessment cycle.

The Role of heritage Data Science in Digital heritage

--

   The advance of all forms of digital and virtual heritage alongside
   numerous heritage science and management applications have led to the
   generation of growing amounts of heritage data. This data is
   increasingly rich, diverse and powerful. To get the most out of
   heritage data, there is an evident need to effectively understand,
   manage and exploit it in a way that is sensitive towards its context,
   responding to its singularities, and that can allow heritage to keep up
   with global changes regarding expansion of digital technologies and the

   Through conversations with industry and academia, as well as through
   their personal research in the field of cultural heritage, the authors
   have identified a need for enhanced training for data scientists to
   prepare them for working in the heritage sector. This paper first
   proposes a definition of the term heritage data, so far missing from
   the literature, and then presents the academic rationale behind the
   identified need for targeted training in data science for cultural
   heritage.

   Alors qu'une bonne partie des Français n'en paiera jamais, l'impôt sur

   estimaient que "l'impôt sur l'héritage devrait augmenter car les

   que "l'impôt sur l'héritage devrait diminuer car il faut permettre aux
   parents de transmettre le plus de patrimoine possible à leurs enfants".
   Les politiques jouent donc sur du velours en prônant la réduction de la
   fiscalité sur l'héritage, même si cette baisse ne profite qu'aux plus

   Selon une étude du CRÉDOC, 28 % des Français auraient déjà bénéficié
   d’un héritage et 16 % d’une donation du vivant. Un tiers des Français
   auraient donc profité soit d’un don soit d’un héritage.

   Près de 13 % des Français bénéficient d’un héritage dépassant 100 000
   euros quand 40 % reçoivent moins de 8 000 euros. Plus les héritiers ont

   Cependant, l’héritage génétique est également un facteur important qui
   influe sur la personnalité et les traits de comportement des individus.
   Dans cet article, nous allons explorer les aspects de la psychologie
   qui sont influencés par l’héritage génétique et comment cela peut
   affecter notre compréhension de nous-mêmes et des autres.

Qu’est-ce que l’héritage génétique ?

   L’héritage génétique est le processus par lequel les caractéristiques

   사망의 조건[4] 외에도 실종선고,[5] 인정사망[6]의 경우도 법률적으론 모두 사망한 것으로 보기 때문에 다 인정되는 거다.
   상속에서 중요한 사실은, 상속되는 재산에는 채무, 즉 빚도 포함된다는 것이다. 위에서 권리와 의무의 일체라는 말에 주목하자! 이
   때문에 상속시 빚투성이 마이너스 재산을 받게 되는 경우가 많다. 이런 경우를 위해 상속포기와 한정승인 제도가 있다. 이에
   대해서는 해당 문단으로.
   상속재산에는 보통 부동산과 현찰만 포함된다고 생각하기 쉬운데 실제로는 각종 권리, 금융자산, 금융적 의무[7] 또한 포함된다.
   만일 A라는 사람이 차로 B를 치어 죽게한 경우 B가 A에게 청구할 수 있는 손해배상청구권도 상속된다. 하지만 벌금은 상속되지
   않는다. 벌금은 재산문제가 아니라 형벌의 문제기 때문에 벌금이 상속되면 연좌제 문제가 생길 수도 있기 때문.[8] 하지만
   미납세금은 따로 한정승인을 하지 않더라도 상속재산 범위 내에서만 책임을 지게 된다. 추징금도 벌금과 같은 이유로 당사자가
   사망하면 그대로 소멸된다.
   그 외에도 상속재산의 확인은 금융감독원의 상속인 조회 서비스에서 피상속인의 금융자산 및 채무를 확인 할 수 있으며 국토교통부에서
   부동산을 확인할 수 있다. 단 피상속인이 사망한 후에 조회할 수 있다. 고인을 떠나보낸 슬픔도 슬픔이지만 적어도 상속포기 가능
   기간인 3개월 이전에는 꼭 확인을 해 보도록 하자. 그래야 피상속자의 채무를 떠안지 않게 된다. 만일 기간이 더 필요할 것
   같으면 미리 가정법원에 상속포기기간연장허가 심판청구(민법 제1019조 제1항 단서)를 하는 것을 고려해 보아야 한다.
   또한 1990년 12월 31일 이전 사망자, 간단하게 망자가 현행민법 시행 이전 사망했는데 아직까지 상속등기가 안되어 있는 경우
   현행민법대로 1.5:1.0 비율로 상속되는 게 아니라 호주상속인에게 50% 가산해주는 제도 등 그 당시 민법에 따라 상속
   이루어지니까 이 점에 각별히 유의하여야 한다.

     * 피상속인이 직역하면 상속을 당하는 사람, 다시 말해 상속을 주는 사람으로서 재산을 남기고 떠나는 사람이고, 상속인이
       상속을 받는 사람이다.[9]

   EX) 甲 할아버지가 돌아가셨다. 甲의 아들인 乙이 甲 할아버지의 재산을 상속받았다
   甲 할아버지 = 피상속인
   乙 = 상속인
     * 대습상속의 경우, 甲 할아버지의 아들이 乙이고 乙에게 어린 아이 丙이 있다고 해 보자.
          + 후술하겠지만 乙이 먼저 사망한 뒤 甲이 사망하면서 대습상속 발생한다.
          + 乙이 먼저 사망한 뒤 甲이 사망하면서, 甲이 피상속인(앞서와 같다.)이고 丙이 대습상속인이 된다. 가운데에 있는
            乙은 피대습상속인(=피대습인)이 된다.

1.2. 상속의 순위[편집]

   민법 제1000조(상속의 순위)
   ①상속에 있어서는 다음 순위로 상속인이 된다.

     * 법인 혹은 계부모 및 계자녀[18], 이혼한 배우자는 상속 대상에서 제외된다. 계부모-계자녀의 경우 혈연적으로 연결된
       사이가 아니기 때문이며, 배우자의 경우 사망 당시 혼인 신고를 유지하고 있어야 한다고 보면 된다. 예를 들면 막장드라마의

       혼인무효사유가 없는한 설사 망자의 생전자산을 전부 써버린다 하더라도 그런 정황에 대한 고려 없이 법적인 배우자로서 일정
       상속분을 떼어주어야 한다. 상속랑 관련은 없지만 이혼한 배우자라도 연금은 분할받을 수 있다.[19]

     * 피상속인 사망 당시 1순위에 해당하는 사람이 없으면 2순위에 해당하는 사람이 받는 식. 비록 생전 망자의 재산증식에
       있어서 일정부분 기여를 했다고 하더라도 선순위자가 있으면 후순위자는 못 받는다. 단, 선순위자가 모두 상속포기를 한다면
       후순위자로 넘어간다.

     * 1순위가 '자녀'가 아니라 '직계비속'이다. 가령, 피상속인이 아들 A, 손자 B가 있었다면, A가 상속을 포기하면 B가
       상속을 받는다.

     * 후술하겠지만 채무 과다로 인한 상속포기의 경우는 피상속인 기준 5순위 상속자까지 모두 포기해야 적법한 상속포기로
       인정된다.

     * 배우자는 동순위 상속인보다 50%씩 가산하여 상속된다는 사실을 유념하여야 한다. 흔히 말하는 1.5 : 1이 이 대목을
       뜻한다.

     * 피상속인에게 4촌 이내 친족이 전무하거나 상속결격 등의 사유로 상속권을 가진 자격이 있는 자가 없는 경우 법원에서
       피상속인의 재산관리인을 직권으로 선임한 다음, 피상속인의 재산관리인은 별도의 기간 동안 혹시 피상속인의 사망 전
       피상속인의 재산을 유증받았거나 반환받아야할 채권이 있는 자가 있다면 자신에게 신고하라는 공고를 해야하고 이때에도 관련된
       상속권을 주장하는 이가 없다면 상속재산 전부 국고에 귀속하게 되는데, 최종적으로 국고에 귀속되기 전 피상속인의 상속권을
       가지고 있지 않지만 특별한 연고[20]가 있다고 주장하는 자가 있다면 피상속인의 재산을 상속(=분여)받을 수 있다.
       하지만 피상속인의 재산을 무조건 전부 다 상속받을 수 있는 것은 아니고 본인의 청구가 있더라도 가정법원에서 그 청구의
       일체적 상당성을 인정받아야 하며 상속의 범위는 법원의 자체적인 판단에 따라야 한다. 또한 특별연고자에게 분여절차가
       완료되었다면 그 이후에 망자(=피상속인)의 재산을 상속받을수 있는 권한을 가진자가 나타났다고 하더라도 이에 관한 반환을
       청구할 수 없다. [21]

2. 상속의 형태[편집]

2.1. 신분상속·재산상속[편집]

   신분상속 호주나 가장 등 일정한 신분을 승계하는 것을 목적으로 하는 상속형태였지만 민법개정으로 인해 호주제가 폐지되면서
   호주승계는 폐지되었다. 그리고 재산상속 두말할 필요도 없이 일반적으로 가장 중요한 상속니 본 문서에서 다루는 상속 중
   대부분이 재산상속에 해당한다.

2.2. 생전상속·사망상속[편집]

   역시 말 그대로 피상속인이 살아있을 때 상속 개시되느냐 혹은 죽고나서 상속하느냐 하는 문젠데, 일반적으로는 사망상속
   원칙이다. 다만, 실제로는 증여제도를 통해 생전상속도 빈번하게 이뤄지고 있다. 이는 세계에서 가장 높은 상속세율 때문이기도
   하다. 그러나 엄청난 부자가 아니면 상속세를 신경 쓸 이유는 없다. 한국의 경우 배우자는 30억까지 자녀는 10억까지의 재산에는
   상속세가 없다.
   또한, 죽음에 대한 금기가 심한 한국의 문화적 특성 때문에 한국인들은 생전상속도 하지 않고 유서도 남기지 않은 채 끝까지
   버티다가 죽고나서 남긴 재산 때문에 사망상속 이후 재산 분할문제로 가족간 분쟁이 잦고 그 양상도 대부분 법정까지 가서 강제로
   정리될 정도로 당사자간 갈등의 강도도 센 편이다. 때문에, 실제로는 사후 상속관련 법령이나 공증을 받아놓은 유언에 따라
   유산분배를 집행해야하지만 그럴 바엔 당사자의 말이 권위를 가질 수 있는 시점인 생전증여가 한국에서 더 많다.

2.3. 법정상속·유언상속[편집]

   법정상속 상속인이 될 자의 범위와 순위가 법률상 정해져 있는 상속 형태이고, 유언상속 피상속인이 상속인을 유언으로 지정하는
   상속 형태다. [DEL: 유언상속의 경우 '유증' 이라고도 표현한다. :DEL] [24] 우리나라의 민법은 법정상속을 기본으로
   하되 유언제도도 인정하고 있다.
   그러나 유언제도는 유류분[25] 제도에 의하여 일정부분 제한되고 있다. 단적인 예로 A라는 사람이 유언으로 '내가 사망한 후 전
   재산을 사회에 환원하겠다.'라고 유언을 남겼고 그 유언이 유언 양식에 맞게 작성되었어도 상속권자가 유류분 신청을 하게 되면
   일정부분[26]은 상속권자에게 보장해야 한다.

2.4. 단독상속·공동상속[편집]

   혼자 받느냐, 여럿이 같이 받느냐에 대한 것인데, 과거 의용민법(일제강점기 당시 민법)상으로는 장남의 단독 상속었으나, 현행
   민법은 공동상속을 원칙으로 하고 있다.[27]

2.5. 강제상속·임의상속[편집]

   강제상속라 함은 상속인의 상속포기를 허용하지 않는 상속 형태를 말하고, 임의 상속라 함은 상속인의 상속포기를 허용하는 상속
   형태를 말한다. 우리나라는 상속포기와 한정승인제도를 인정함으로써 임의상속제도를 채택하고 있다.

2.6. 균분상속·불균분상속[편집]

   공동상속인의 상속 비율이 평등한가 그렇지 않은가에 따른 분류로, 우리나라는 균분상속 원칙이나, 배우자가 직계비속(자녀) 또는
   직계존속(부모)과 공동상속할 경우 5할을 가산하도록 하고 있다.
   즉, 아버지 A와 어머니 B, 자녀 C(장남), D(차남), E(딸)가 있을 경우, A의 사망으로 인한 A 재산의 상속
   배우자인 B의 경우 5할을 가산하여 1.5, 자녀 C, D, E에게는 1:1:1로 배분한다. 마찬가지로, 남편 A와 아내 B,
--
   받는다. 다만, A의 재산을 유지 혹은 증가하는 데에 특별히 기여한 점이 있다고 인정될 때에는 재산을 가산하는데 기여한 만큼의
   상속분을 법원에서 100% 보장해 주기도 한다. 만약에 오랜기간 병마와 싸우다가 타계한 피상속인에게 배우자와 1남 1녀가
   있었는데, 법원에서 아버지를 헌신적으로 간호해온 딸에게 기여도를 30% 인정한다면 법적인 상속분은 배우자 3/7(42%)+아들
   2/7(29%)+딸 2/7(29%)인데 기여도를 반영하여 최종적으로는 배우자 30%(70% 中 3/7) + 아들 20%(70%

2.7. 본위상속과 대습상속[편집]

   민법 제1000조(상속의 순위)
   ①상속에 있어서는 다음 순위로 상속인이 된다.
   1. 피상속인의 직계비속
   2. 피상속인의 직계존속
   3. 피상속인의 형제자매
   4. 피상속인의 4촌 이내의 방계혈족
   민법 제1001조(대습상속) 전조제1항제1호와 제3호의 규정에 의하여 상속인이 될 직계비속 또는 형제자매가 상속개시전에
   사망하거나 결격자가 된 경우에 그 직계비속이 있는 때에는 그 직계비속이 사망하거나 결격된 자의 순위에 갈음하여 상속인이 된다.
   민법 제1003조(배우자의 상속순위)
   ②제1001조의 경우에 상속개시전에 사망 또는 결격된 자의 배우자는 동조의 규정에 의한 상속인과 동순위로 공동상속인이 되고 그
   상속인이 없는 때에는 단독상속인이 된다.
   민법 제1000조는 상속 순위를 정해놓아 피상속인의 직계비속[28]과 배우자가 우선 상속 받고 피상속인의 직계비속이 없으면
   직계존속[29]과 배우자, 직계존속도 없으면 배우자가 단독 상속하고, 배우자도 없으면 형제 자매가 상속하며, 형제 자매도 없으면
   4촌 이내의 방계 혈족이 상속 받도록 규정하고 있다. 보통 상속라고 하면 이 본위상속을 가리킨다.
   대습상속 말 그대로 다른 사람을 대신해 상속을 받는 것을 가리킨다. 민법 제1001조는 대습상속에 대해 규정하고 있다.
   피상속인의 직계비속 또는 형제(이를 피대습자라 한다)가 피상속인보다 먼저 죽었을 경우, 그가 피상속인보다 오래 살았을 경우 그가
   상속 받을 만큼의 재산을 그의 직계비속과 배우자가 상속 받게 된다.
   이와 관련하여 유명한 판례가 있다. 대한항공 801편 추락 사고로 사위를 제외한 일가족이 사망하였는데, 장인의 천억대 재산을
   사위가 물려받느냐 장인의 방계혈족(형제자매)이 물려 받느냐를 놓고 법적 분쟁이 벌어졌다.
   장인이 먼저 사망했을 경우 장인→딸→사위의 순서로 사위가 상속을 받게 되고, 딸이 먼저 사망했을 경우에는 장인의 재산을 먼저
   사망한 딸 대신 사위가 대습상속을 받게 되므로 어느 경우에도 사위가 단독으로 재산을 상속한다.
   여기서 방계혈족 측이 주장한 핵심 쟁점은 장인과 딸이 동시에 사망한 것을 추정했을 때인데, 방계혈족 측은 사망의 전후를 가릴 수
   없으니 동시사망으로 추정해야 한다고 주장했다. 동시사망 추정시 ①동시사망한 사람들 간에는 상속 발생하지 않으므로, ②딸이
   상속권이 없으니 사위가 대습상속을 받을 수 없게 되며, ③그러므로 차순위인 형제자매가 상속권자가 된다는 주장이였다.
   하지만 대법원에서는 동시사망 추정의 입법취지가 "사망의 순서를 알 수 없는 경우에 공평함을 추구하기 위한 것"이라는 점을 중요시
   했는데, 이 경우에는 장인이 먼저 죽거나 아내가 먼저 죽거나 결과가 동일한데 공평함을 추구하기 위한 법에 의해 다른 결과가
   나오는 것은 불합리하다고 판단했다. 그러므로 대습상속에 규정된 '피상속인이 상속 개시 전에 사망'이라는 것이 '상속 개시와
   동시에 사망 한 것'도 포함해야 한다고 판단하여 사위가 대습상속을 받아야 한다고 판결했다.
   흔히 장인과 딸의 사망 순서에 따라 상속자가 갈리는 것으로 알고 있는 사람들이 꽤 많은데, 순서가 쟁점이 아니라 동시 사망이라는
   새로운 경우에 대한 해석 문제였다. 법학을 공부한다면 전공이든 교양이든 간에 1년에 한 번 혹은 한 학기에 한 번 이상은 꼭
   듣는다. 대법원 2001. 3. 9. 선고 99다13157 판결[30]
   본다. 따라서 피상속인의 자식들이 모두 사망하였을 때와 모두 상속 포기하였을 때 손자녀들이 받는 상속분이 달라질 수 있다.
   전자는 대습상속라 형제 수에 따라 상속분이 달라지지만 후자는 대습상속 아니라 본위상속므로 손자녀들이 균분 상속한다. 즉
   피상속인 A가 사망하였는데 A에게는 자식 B, C가 있었고 B에게는 자녀가 둘, C에게는 자녀가 한 명 있었으며 모두 배우자는
   없다고 가정해보자. 이 경우 B, C가 A가 죽기 전에 사망하였다면 그 자녀들은 각자 B, C의 상속분을 대습상속하므로 B의
   자녀들은 B의 상속분인 0.5를 균분 상속하여 상속재산의 0.25씩을 받게 되며 C의 자녀는 C의 상속분을 단독상속하여
   상속재산의 0.5를 받게 된다. 그러나 B, C가 상속포기를 한 것이라면 그 자녀들은 조부의 재산을 본위상속하므로 B의 자녀와
   C의 자녀 모두 1/3씩 상속 받게 된다. 그렇지만 현실적으로는 상속포기를 할 정도라면 빚이 더 많은 경우가 대다수라 장남 한
   명이 한정승인을 하고 끝내던가 아니면 전부 상속포기[31] 로 이어지는 게 전체 사건의 95% 이상이라 크게 의미가 없다.

--
   별거 아닌 거 같지만 이게 왜 중요한가 하면.. 예를 들어 갑부 A가 외동아들 C와 여행을 갔다가 위난으로 사망했을 경우, 사망
   순서에 따라 배우자 B와 A의 어머니 D(B의 시어머니)의 상속 순서가 문제된다는 것이다.
   즉, ① A와 C의 사망시기를 알지 못해 동시사망으로 추정될 경우, A의 재산은 B(1.5)와 D(1)가 공동으로 상속받게
   된다. ② 사망시기를 알았는데 C가 먼저 사망하고 A가 사망한 경우라면, A의 상속인은 B와 D가 공동상속인이 되기 때문에
   1번과 같은 결과가 된다. ③ 그러나, A가 먼저 사망하고 C가 사망한 것으로 밝혀졌다면 A의 사망으로 우선 공동상속인인
   B(1.5)와 C(1)가 상속받은 것으로 보고, 이후에 C의 사망으로 인해 C의 상속분이 다시 B에게로 넘어간 것으로 보기
   때문에 A의 재산을 B가 독차지하게 된다.

3.2. 상속인의 결격사유[편집]

   민법 제1004조(상속인의 결격사유) 다음 각 호의 어느 하나에 해당한 자는 상속인이 되지 못한다.
   1. 고의로 직계존속, 피상속인, 그 배우자 또는 상속의 선순위나 동순위에 있는 자를 살해하거나 살해하려한 자
   2. 고의로 직계존속, 피상속인과 그 배우자에게 상해를 가하여 사망에 이르게 한 자
   3. 사기 또는 강박으로 피상속인의 상속에 관한 유언 또는 유언의 철회를 방해한 자
   4. 사기 또는 강박으로 피상속인의 상속에 관한 유언을 하게 한 자
   5. 피상속인의 상속에 관한 유언서를 위조ㆍ변조ㆍ파기 또는 은닉한 자
--
   하)거나 유언 조작을 해야 재산을 안 물려주는 것이 가능하다. 바꿔 말하면 재산을 빨리 물려받거나 자기가 독차지하고 싶은 마음에
   부모나 형제를 해치면 원하는 대로 되기는 커녕 단 한푼도 건지지 못한다는 것. 다만 상속 박탈된 사람의 상속분은 직계비속이
   대습상속을 하게 된다. 예를 들어서 A라는 사람에게 아들 B, 손자 C가 있는데, B가 고의로 A를 죽였다면 B는 당연히
   상속결격자가 되고 대신 C가 상속을 받게 된다. 실제로 10억대 재산을 상속받기 위해 홀어머니와 미혼인 형을 동생이 살해한
   사건에서 동생은 상속결격자가 되어 동생의 배우자가 대습상속한 판례가 있다.
   부모의 재산을 탐하여 살해한 박한상의 경우가 유명한데 자동 상속결격이 되어 형제가 그에게 갔을 몫까지 모두 상속을
   받았다.[33] 남양주 니코틴 살인사건처럼 상속 절차가 끝나고 살인 행각이 뒤늦게 밝혀진 경우에는 범인이 이미 상속한 것이
   무효가 되고 차순위 상속인에게 넘어갔고.[34]
   상속결격도 맹점이 있는데 대표적으로 '○○치사' 사건에서 문제가 된다. 예컨대 아동학대로 사망한 피상속인의 친모가 친부와 계모를
   상대로 민사소송을 제기했는데 피고인 친부가 학대를 했지만 고의가 없었다고 하면 명백히 고인을 죽음에 이르게 한 가해자에게
   상속권이 인정된다는 것이다. 구리 왕숙천 지적장애인 동생 살해 사건에서도, 차남을 죽게 만든 장남이 1심에서는 살인으로
   인정받았으나 증거가 부족하다며 2심에서 유기치사로 죄명이 바뀌고 형량도 대폭 깎였다. 10년 정도 썩고 출소하고 나면 수십억원에

   신호를 줄 수 있는 판결이다. 이제는 대놓고 죽이지 않고 버릴 것이다'하고 우려한 사건이다.
   또한 망자에게 부모와 배우자가 있는데 배우자 복중에 태아가 있는 상황이라면 법정상속인은 배우자와 복중태아(직계비속)이지만,
   배우자가 그 복중태아를 낙태한경우 민법상 동순위상속인을 살해한 것으로 해석하여 시부모(직계존속) 혹은 차순위 상속자(형제자매
   등)에게 상속권이 전부 넘어간다.[35] 다만 피상속인에게 배우자의 복중에 태아가 있지만 낙태를 하지 않고, 임신한 상황에서
   일부러 계단에서 한두 번 굴러 고의적이었지만 법적으로 고의성을 밝히기 어려운 방법으로 자연유산한 경우 만일 그 현장에
   CCTV라도 있지 않는 이상 자기 자신이 사고라고 우기면 의학적으로나 법학적으로나 사고라고 해석할 수밖에 없기 때문에 "사고"로
   해석되어 피상속인의 상속분은 배우자 1.5 : 시부모 1.0의 비율로 상속되거나 피상속인에게 직계혈족이 없다면 배우자가 전부
   가져간다. 일반적으로 임신 중인 아내를 두고 남편이 죽어 "상속"이라는 사건이 발생하는 경우는 자주 없고 혹시 있다하더라도 저런
   모험과 반인륜적인 행위를 하기에는 액수면에서도 드문 사례이기는 하지만 낙태의 경우를 제외하더라도[36] 자해행위, 고의사고를
   통한 고의적인 자연유산의 경우 실제로 있는 사건이기는 했다. 법적으로 그 고의성을 증명하지 못하여 그 배우자는 자신의
   원(元)상속분을 전부 받아갔지만, 그리고 고의성이 설사 입증되었다고 하더라도 인위적인 방법을 통해 직접적으로, 의도적으로 태아의
   생명을 잃게하기 위한 목적으로 복중태아에게 위해를 가하는 낙태시술과는 달리 산모 자신이 본인의 몸을 자기 자유의 의지로 막 다뤄
   간접적으로 복중태아를 사망하게 만든 경우에 이것을 과연 살인으로 봐야할 것인지에 관한 문제가 있어서...
   또 배우자가 일단 상속받은 이후, 해외입양을 보내고 연락을 끊어 대한민국 국적을 박탈하도록 유도하는 방법도 있는 듯하지만, 언뜻
   보면 태아 입장에서 친부모를 모르고, 산모의 친족들은 아이의 소재를 몰라 외국인 양부모 손에서 외국에서 성장하여 한국과는 전혀
   관계없이 추후 성인이 되더라도 아예 남남으로 갈수도 있는것 아닌가하는 추측이 나올수도 있는데 일단 그 태아 상속몫까지 배우자가
   전부 가지게 되는것은 아니다. 법적으로 관계당국에서는 그 태아가 태어날때까지 상속처리를 유보하고 있다. 때문에 해외로
   보낸다치더라도 상속처리를 하여 재산권행사를 할 수 없어 그 배우자 입장에서는 이 경우 결국엔 시부모와 나누든지 태어날 아이와
   나누든지 선택하는 수밖에 없다.

   모른다.
   이게 쉽지 않다는 의견도 있다. 애당초 유류분 제도가 생긴 이유가 아들(특히 장남)에게만 몰빵 상속하던 풍습에 딸들이 반발하여
   딸들에게도 최소한 몫을 보장하기 위하여 도입된 것이므로, 이것이 없어지면 엄청난 혼란이 생긴다는 것. 그러나 과거와 달리 지금은
   부모나 자녀, 형제자매가 함께 재산을 불려나간다고 보기 어렵고 자녀의 숫자도 줄어 아들과 딸 간 재산상속 크게 차이나지
   않는다. 요즘 세상에 딸이라는 이유만으로 단 한푼도 물려주지 않는 부모가 흔할 거라 보기는 어렵다. 게다가 이게 위헌심판 청구된

   민법 제1112조(유류분의 권리자와 유류분) 상속인의 유류분은 다음 각호에 의한다.
   1. 피상속인의 직계비속은 그 법정상속분의 2분의 1
   2. 피상속인의 배우자는 그 법정상속분의 2분의 1
   3. 피상속인의 직계존속은 그 법정상속분의 3분의 1
   4. 피상속인의 형제자매는 그 법정상속분의 3분의 1

          제1113조(유류분의 산정)
          ①유류분은 피상속인의 상속개시시에 있어서 가진 재산의 가액에 증여재산의 가액을 가산하고 채무의 전액을 공제하여 이를
          산정한다.
          ②조건부의 권리 또는 존속기간이 불확정한 권리는 가정법원이 선임한 감정인의 평가에 의하여 그 가격을 정한다.
          제1114조(산입될 증여) 증여는 상속개시전의 1년간에 행한 것에 한하여 제1113조의 규정에 의하여 그 가액을
          산정한다. 당사자 쌍방이 유류분권리자에 손해를 가할 것을 알고 증여를 한 때에는 1년전에 한 것도 같다.
          제1115조(유류분의 보전)
          ①유류분권리자가 피상속인의 제1114조에 규정된 증여 및 유증으로 인하여 그 유류분에 부족이 생긴 때에는 부족한
          한도에서 그 재산의 반환을 청구할 수 있다.
--
          제1116조(반환의 순서) 증여에 대하여는 유증을 반환받은 후가 아니면 이것을 청구할 수 없다.
          제1117조(소멸시효) 반환의 청구권은 유류분권리자가 상속의 개시와 반환하여야 할 증여 또는 유증을 한 사실을 안
          때로부터 1년내에 하지 아니하면 시효에 의하여 소멸한다. 상속 개시한 때로부터 10년을 경과한 때도 같다.
          제1118조(준용규정) 제1001조, 제1008조, 제1010조[37]의 규정은 유류분에 이를 준용한다.

   유류분이란 피상속인이 상속인에게 묻지도 따지지도 않고 무조건 상속해야 하는[38] 일정한 범위 이상의 재산을 말한다. 민법
   제1112조에 따르면 유류분의 비율은 직계비속과 배우자는 그 법정상속분의 1/2, 직계존속과 형제자매는 그 1/3이다. 당연한
   소리지만 직계존속 / 형제자매의 각각 우선순위가 앞서는 직계비속 / 직계비속, 직계존속, 배우자[39]가 모두 없을 경우에만
   유류분을 주장할 수 있다.
   쉽게 말하면 재산을 물려주기 싫은 경우[40]에도 죽으면 무조건 일정액 이상은 재산을 물려줘야 한다는 것이다. 평소에 피상속인과
   그 가족에게 심대한 민폐를 끼친 상속인이라도 상속박탈조건에 해당되지 않으면 무조건 상속을 해야 한다는 법이다. 이 점으로 인해
   한국의 유류분 제도가 문제가 많다는 지적이 있다[41][42]. 아래에도 나와있지만 재산을 물려주기 싫을 정도로 피상속인을
   괴롭혔던 상속인에게도 상속박탈조건에 해당되지 않으면 유류분은 무조건 줘야 하기 때문이다.[43] 사실 사망전에 사전증여를 해도
   증여를 받지 못한 상속인이 소송을 통해 유류분을 청구하면 받을 수 있기 때문에 증여를 해도 별 소용이 없다.[44] 사실 이
   제도를 없애는 것도 곤란한 것이 부모가 자기 마음에 안 든다는 이유만으로 아무 죄도 없는 자식에게 상속을 안 줘서 일부러
   거지꼴로 내몰 수도 있기 때문. 이를 막기 위한 안전장치인 셈. 그러나 워낙 말이 많았던 터라 기어코 위헌법률심판을 받게
   되었으며, 해외의 경우는 패륜아가 재산을 물려받는 상황을 막기 위하여 유류분을 박탈하는 추세로 가고 있다.
   또한, 재산을 금융회사에 맡기고 금융회사가 본인의 유언에 따라 상속을 집행하는 유언대용신탁을 할 경우 유류분이 사실상 발생하지
   않게 된다. 2020년에 신탁자산은 ‘유류분’ 적용 대상이 아니라는 법원 판결이 처음으로 나왔다.[45]

3.4. 상속의 포기와 한정승인[편집]

   민법 제1019조(승인, 포기의 기간)
   ①상속인은 상속개시있음을 안 날로부터 3월내에 단순승인이나 한정승인 또는 포기를 할 수 있다. 그러나 그 기간은 이해관계인 또는
   검사의 청구에 의하여 가정법원이 이를 연장할 수 있다.
   민법 제1025조(단순승인의 효과) 상속인이 단순승인을 한 때에는 제한없이 피상속인의 권리의무를 승계한다.
   민법 제1028조(한정승인의 효과) 상속인은 상속으로 인하여 취득할 재산의 한도에서 피상속인의 채무와 유증을 변제할 것을
   조건으로 상속을 승인할 수 있다.
   민법 제1042조(포기의 소급효) 상속의 포기는 상속개시된 때에 소급하여 그 효력이 있다.
   상속 포기는 쉽게 말하면 재산을 안 물려 받겠다는 이야기이다. 주로 재산을 받기 위한 목적이라기보다는 피상속인의 채무를 정리하기
   위하여 이용되는 제도이다. 상속 재산에는 빚도 포함되기 때문이다. 예컨대 피상속인으로부터 상속받을 재산은 1억인데 빚은 10억쯤
   된다든가 하는 경우에는 차라리 상속을 받지 않는 것이 낫다. 그래서 배보다 배꼽이 더 큰 경우, 피상속인의 사망을 안 날로부터
   3개월 이내에 상속을 받지 않겠다고 가정법원(가정법원이 설치 안된 곳은 지방법원이나 그 지원)에 심판청구서를 내면 된다.
   그러나 문제는 상속을 포기한다고 채무가 곧바로 사라지는 것이 아니라는 것이다. 결론부터 이야기하자면 모든 상속인들이
   모조리(일치단결하여) 상속을 포기해야 채무가 사라진다. 달리 말하자면 최우선 상속인이 상속을 포기할 경우 그 이외의
   차순위상속인에게 곧바로 넘어가게 된다는 것이다. 즉, 내가 포기하면 형제가 있을 경우, 내가 갚을 분량만큼 형제가 더
   부담해야하고, 형제도 역시 나와 같이 상속을 포기할 경우 할아버지, 할머니에게 넘어가고, 조부모가 계시지 않을 경우에는 백부,
   숙부(삼촌), 고모에게 넘어가며, 이들도 없을 경우에는 사촌형제에게 넘어가기까지 한다. 실제로 재산 중에 채무가 수십억이라는 걸
   안 아들이 바로 상속을 포기했는데, 은행측이 5살 먹은 손자에게 재산이 상속되었으니 채무를 변제하라는 주장을 하는 바람에 재판을
   벌인 사건이 있다. 법원은 상속 당시 법무사의 의견을 들어 자동적으로 손자도 상속을 포기한 것이라고 생각했다고 주장한 부모의
   손을 들어줬다. 법에 대해 잘 모르는 사람일 경우 그렇게 생각할 수도 있다는 걸 다른 곳도 아닌 판결문에서 인정했다. 은행
--
   보이긴 한다. 물론 채무의무가 넘어갔어도 만 19세가 되기 전까지는 추심하지 못하게 되어있고, 만 19세가 넘어 성인이 되었다면
   "상속 당시 채무계약에 관하여 이해할 지적인 능력이 없었고 의사결정 및 판단능력도 없었다." 논리로 채무계약(상환 의무)승계
   무효소송을 내면 된다.[46]
   따라서, 이럴 때를 위하여 이용되는 것이 바로 상속의 한정승인 제도이다. 이것은 피상속인의 채무를 물려받은 재산에 한하여
   이행하겠다는 조건으로 상속받는 것으로써, 빚이 아무리 많더라도 물려받은 재산만큼만 내면 모든 채무를 이행한 것으로 보는 것이다.
   역시 이것도 상속포기와 마찬가지로 상속의 개시가 있음을 안 날로부터 3개월, 혹은 상속재산보다 채무가 더 크다는 것을 안
   날로부터 3개월 이내에 하면 된다.[47]
   그렇기 때문에 만약 상속받을 일이 있다면, 특히 상속재산보다 빚이 더 큰 경우나 애매한 경우라면 한정승인 제도를 활용하도록
   하자. 웬만큼 상속 재산이 확연히 많지 않은 경우에는 그냥 한정승인하는 것이 속편하다. 만약 재산이 빚보다 많다 하더라도 채무를
   정산한 나머지 부분에 대해서는 받을 수 있기 때문이다. 간단히 말해서 상속포기는 나(이 글을 보는 여러분 본인)를 기준으로 했을
   때 전 순위 친족이 모두 상속포기해야 효과가 있다. 한정승인의 경우 현물재산(주로 부동산)은 절대로 받을 수 없다. 법원에서
   경매를 통해 피상속인(사망자)의 현물재산을 전부 경매 매각하고 빚을 정리하기 때문이다. 나머지 잔여재산이 있으면 현금으로만 받을
   수 있다.
   주의할 점은 한정승인을 받을 경우 철저하게 상속받을 재산을 하나부터 열까지 모두 파악해야 하고, 절대 재산을 빼돌리려는 시도를
   해서는 안 된다. 상속 절차에는 기업의 법정관리나 파산/회생처럼 절차 진행에 앞서 피상속인 및 상속인을 비롯한 모든 이해관계인의
   법률행위를 중지시키는 제도(포괄적 금지/중지명령)는 없다. 따라서 재산을 빼돌리는 건 사해행위에 해당하고, 그 경우에는
--
   때문에 재산이 누락되었거나[48] 빼돌려졌을 경우 채권자가 이걸 알고 민사소송에서 다투는 경우가 왕왕 있다. 한정승인은 백이면
   백 상속재산보다 빚이 더 큰 경우에 하는 일이 많아서 채권자 입장에서는 돈 일부를 떼먹히는 일이 된다. 그래서 채권자는 액수가
   크면 클 수록 눈에 불을 켜고 사해행위가 있었는지 찾게 된다.
--
   대행해준다. 그러나 법무사나 변호사 사무실마다 가격차이가 크므로[50] 여러 곳에서 견적을 받아보는 것이 좋다.[51]
   일반적으로 상속포기는 10~20만 원, 한정승인은 30~40만 원 선에서 처리 가능. 한정승인을 하려면 변호사 + 공인회계사
   조합을 권한다. 내가 모르고 있던 재산과 빚을 회계사가 찾아준다. 그 다음에 변호사를 통해 한정승인 서류를 작성하여 법원에
   제출하면 채권자도 말 한 마디 못하고 한정승인이 시작된다.
   일반적으로 알고 있는 단순한 상속포기는 사해행위로 취소할 수 없다. 상속포기를 사해행위로 취소할 수 있는 경우는 상속자들이
   상속재산 분할협의를 할 경우다. 예를 들어 상속인 A와 B가 있는데 상속인 A가 상속포기만 한다면 사해행위 취소가 불가능하다.
   상속포기를 했다고 볼 수 있기 때문에 사해행위로 걸리는 것이다. 이에 대한 기사
   참 안타까운 게, 3개월[52] 안에 절차를 밟지 않으면 특별한정승인조차 하지 못해 고스란히 빚을 물려받게 된다. 2023년

   만들어버리는 상황'은 더 이상 일어나지 않게 되었다.
   판결했다.# 예컨대 피상속인 A가 사망하여 상속인 B(처), C(자녀)와 차순위 상속인 D(모)가 모두 상속을 포기하고, 이후
   D가 사망하여 B, C가 대습상속을 하게 된 경우 기존의 A에 대한 상속포기 효력은 대습상속에 미치지 않는다.

   이 문서 상단부분에도 간략히 나와있다시피, 피상속인의 자산을 상속받을 수 있는 적법한 상속인이 없는 경우 피상속인의 특별연고자가
   관계법원에 피상속인의 상속자산 중 일부분여를 요청할 수 있다. 다만 법원 판단에 의하여 전액 다 받지 못할 수도 있음에
   유의하여야 한다.

   국고귀속은 상속인[57]이 없고 특별연고자도 없거나 특별연고자에게 분여하고 남는 재산을 국고로 귀속하는 것이다. 한국법에서
   지식재산권의 경우에는 권리가 소멸하도록 하고 있다.[58]

   되고 그 직계비속이 없는 때에는 단독상속인이 된다.'이다. 쉽게 말해, 자녀가 없는 상태로 아내가 사망했을 때, 아내의 부모가
   존재하더라도 남편이 단독상속을 받을 수 있었다. 그러나 남녀평등에 반한다는 이유로 1990년 폐지. 현행에서는 남편, 아내 구분

상속재산분할협의 가족간에 정리 하려면

--
   하지만 이는 시작에 불과하며, 인구 추계를 보면 앞으로 더 많은 사망자가 매년 나올 것으로 추정되고 있는 상황이다. 그만큼
   재산에 대한 상속과 관련해서 법률적 분쟁을 겪게 되는 사람들도 많아질 것으로 보인다.

   법률상 사람은 자연인으로, 재산에 대한 소유권이나 처분권 등을 향유할 수 있는 법적 주체이다. 사망을 하게 되면 더 이상 해당
   재산에 대한 법률적 주체는 없게 된다. 따라서 그 재산은 법률상 상속권을 가지고 있는 자들에게 포괄적으로 승계가 되는데, 이는
   당연승계이다.

   만약 피상속인이 남긴 재산이 전부 가분적인 현금이라면 각자의 법정 상속지분에 따라서 이를 수령하는 것으로 간단하게 상속재산분할은
   마무리가 될 수 있을 것이다. 하지만 우리나라 가구의 절대다수는 부동산에 재산이 편중되어 있고, 주식과 같은 다른 유가증권
--

   이러한 경우 이를 어떻게 나누어 가져야 하는지를 두고 공동상속인들간의 분쟁이 발생하게 되는 일이 많다. 같은 재산이라 하더라도
   어떠한 상속재산분할협의를 하는지에 따라서 이득은 크게 달라질 수 있기 때문에 상속변호사의 도움을 받아 합리적으로 진행하는 것이
   안전하다.

   상속재산분할협의가 이루어지기 위해서는 우선 상속재산에 대한 분할금지 제한이 없어야 한다. 민법에서는 피상속인이 자신이 사망을 한
   이후에도 일정기간 재산형태가 그대로 유지될 수 있도록 유언을 할 수 있도록 하고 있다.

   따라서 만약 피상속인이 유언을 통해서 재산의 전부나 일부를 상속인들 전원 혹은 일부로 하여금 5년 동안은 분할을 할 수 없도록
   할 수 있다. 이러한 유언이 있었다면 그 기간이 경과한 다음에 상속재산분할협의가 가능하다. 다만 상속인들 사이에서 다시 5년의
   기간 안에 분할을 하지 않겠다는 합의를 하여도 무방하다.

   상속재산분할의 대상이 되는 재산 중에서 가분이 가능한 것은 기본적으로 제외된다. 가분적 채권, 채무라는 것은 말 그대로 나눌 수
   있는 것을 말한다. 대표적으로 금전이 있다. 이는 피상속인의 사망과 동시에 바로 법정상속분에 따라서 공동상속인들 각각에게
   자동으로 분할되어 승계되기 때문에 이는 애초에 분할대상에서 제외가 되는 것이다.

   다만 공동상속인 중에 특별수익자나 기여분권자가 있는 경우라면 가분재산이라 하더라도 무조건 법정상속분에 따르지는 않는다, 이러한
   경우 상속분대로 바로 승계가 된다면 오히려 공평의 원칙에 합치되지 않기 때문이다.

   비가분채권, 채무에 대해서 상속재산분할협의가 이루어지게 되는데, 이는 공동상속인들의 전원 참여가 필요하다. 법적으로 상속권을
   가지고 있는 자는 물론, 피상속인으로부터 포괄유증을 받은 자, 공동상속인의 상속인, 상속분의 양수인은 상속재산분할협의에 참여를
   할 수 있다.

   경우에 따라서는 상속인의 채권자도 상속재산분할 청구를 할 수 있다. 이는 상속권자가 상속재산분할협의에 참여를 하지 않고 있는
   경우, 채권자대위의 방법으로 분할청구권 행사가 가능한 것이다.

   만약 협의를 하는 사람 중에서 상속권이 인정되지 않는 사람이 있다거나 상속인의 일부를 제외하고 협의가 이루어진다면 그러한
   상속재산분할협의는 무효가 된다. 모든 상속인들에게 협의를 할 수 있는 기회를 주지 않으면 원천무효가 되기 때문이다.

   만약 상속권을 가지고 있는 사람 중 일부가 미성년자라면, 그 미성년자를 대신해서 협의를 진행해줄 수 있는 특별대리인 선임이
   되어야 한다. 만약 1명의 친권자가 수명의 미성년자에 대한 법정대리인이 된다면 이는 이해관계 상반에 해당하기 때문에 각각 다른
--

   구체적인 상속재산분할의 방식에는 대금분할, 현물분할, 가격분할 및 이들을 종합한 방안 등이 있습니다. 현물분할은 물리적으로
   물건을 분할하는 것, 가격분할은 상속자 중 1인이 다른 상속자의 지분을 전부 매수하여 단속소유권자가 되고, 그 지분에 상응하는
   가액을 보상하는 것을 말한다. 상속재산에 대한 평가는 분할시를 기준으로 하며, 분할에 따른 효력을 상속 개시시로 소급되어 효력이
   발생하게 된다.

   상속재산에 대한 분할을 비롯해서 상속분에 대한 계산, 특별수익자나 유류분 계산 등은 복잡한 사항일 수밖에 없다. 막연히
   가족이라는 이유로 잘 해결되겠지라는 생각만 하다가는 큰 낭패를 볼 수 밖에 없다. 당장 자신이 상속관련 분쟁에 휘말린 상황이라면
   상속관련 법리에 대한 이해에 정통한 상속변호사를 통해서 해결함이 바람직할 것이다.</text>

억만장자 '새 회원' 비결은? "자수성가보다 상속"

--
   [kbc202312010150.800x.8.jpg] ▲ 달러 자료 이미지
   지난해 새로 억만장자 반열에 오른 자산 10억 달러 이상 부자들의 재산은 자수성가보다 상속 덕분에 형성된 경우가 더 많다는
   조사가 나왔습니다.

   원)로 조사됐습니다.
   이 가운데 상속받은 금액은 1,508억 달러(196조3천억여 원)로 집계돼 이들이 보유한 자산의 절반을 넘었습니다.
   그동안 신흥 부호들 가운데에는 정보기술(IT) 분야 등 새로운 시장의 확대나 자산시장의 변동·성장 등에 힘입어 재산이 불어난
   자수성가형 창업자가 많았지만, 점차 이런 경향 대신 상속으로 부자가 되는 경우가 늘고 있다고 보고서는 분석했습니다.
   지난해 증시에 상장한 기업 수가 감소하면서 기업가들이 사업 수익으로 부를 늘릴 기회가 줄어든 점도 상속형 부자가 상대적으로
   증가한 배경으로 꼽혔습니다.
   부호들이 자산을 자녀 세대로 이전하는 현상은 앞으로 더 많아질 것이라고 보고서는 전망했습니다.

   ♣ 사례 1 상속개시전 처분재산 상속추정금액 계산방법


   1. 피상속인 갑이 2011. 12. 1.에 토지를 15억원에 양도하기로 다음과 같이 매매계약을 체결하고 계약금과 중도금을
   수령하고 잔금을 영수하기 전인 2012. 3. 1.에 사망함.
--

   물음 상속재산에 포함되는 추정금액은?

--

   1. 부동산 매매계약이행중인 재산에 해당하여 양도대금전액에서 상속개시전에 수령한 계약금과 중도금을 차감한 잔액만 상속재산에
   포함된다. 다만, 상속개시전에 수령한 계약금과 중도금은 상속개시전 처분재산에 해당하며, 사용처가 불분명한 경우 상속인이 상속받은
   것으로 추정한다.
--

   2. 양도시기가 도래하기 전에 피상속인이 사망하였으므로 상속인이 상속받은 재산을 양도한 것으로 보아 상속인에게 양도소득세
   납부의무가 있게 된다. 양도소득세가 과세되는 경우에도 양도가액과 취득가액이 동일하여 양도차익이 발생하지 않아 부담할 양도소득세는

   ♣ 사례 2 상속개시전 처분재산 상속추정금액 계산방법


   o 상속개시일전 8개월전에 피상속인이 금융기관으로부터 11억원을 대출받았으며, 이중 3억원은 다른 부채의 상환에 사용한 것으로
   입증되었고 나머지는 사용처가 불분명함.
--

   물음 상속재산에 포함될 상속추정재산가액은?

--

   ☞ 피상속인의 예금계좌에서 인출한 금액에는 피상속인의 부동산처분대금(또는 채무를 부담액) 중 당해 계좌에 예입되었다가 인출한
   것도 포함되며, 계좌에 입금된 부동산처분대금 또는 채무부담액은 용도가 객관적으로 명백한 것으로 봄(서면4팀-1862,
--

   ☞ 상속개시전 처분재산가액이 2억원 또는 5억원 이상인지 여부는 총매매대금을 기준으로 판단함(서면4팀-1790,
   2004.11.04)
--

   ☞ 배우자상속공제액 산정시 배우자가 상속받은 것으로 추정하여 상속세과세가액에 산입되는 추정상속재산가액이 ‘배우자가 실제 상속받은
   금액’에 포함여부(재재산-566, 2007. 05.15) - 포함하지 않음.
--

   ☞ 상속개시일 2년 이내에 인출액 중 사용처가 불분명하나, 피상속인의 생활수준이나, 사회통념상 인정할 수 있는 범위 내에 생활비
   지출인 경우 구체적인 증빙이 없더라도 용도가 불불명하다고 볼 수 없다는 사례(심사상속2003-3005, 2005.03.21)

--

   ☞ 상속개시일전 1년 이내에 피상속인의 예금계좌에서 인출된 금액으로 사용처가 불분명한 것은 상속세과세가액에 포함되나 통상적인
   생활비ㆍ간병비 등은 제외함이 타당하다는 사례(함국심2004중3512, 2005.05.04)

   상속개시일 3개월 이내
   1) 예금 및 보험 지급 청구 및 금융거래 상세 내역 준비
    ‘안심 상속 원스톱 서비스’를 통해 파악한 피상속인의 예금 및 보험 정보를 기반으로 각 은행, 우체국, 증권사, 보험사에
   사망진단서, 가족관계증명서 등 피상속인과 상속인의 관계를 입증할 서류를 지참하여 지급청구를 할 시기다.
    지급 청구 차 방문 시에는 꼭 피상속인의 10년간 계좌 내역 일체와 보험료 납입 내역 등 추후 상속세 신고를 위한 각종 자료도
   요청하여 두 번 방문하는 일이 없도록 하는 것이 중요하다. 이때 발급받은 금융거래 내역, 보험료 납입 내역 등을 통해 금융재산
--

   2) 상속 포기 또는 한정승인 신고기한
    상속 포기는 상속으로 인하여 생기는 모든 권리와 의무의 승계를 부정하고 처음부터 상속인이 아니었던 효력을 생기게 하는 단독의
   의사표시다. 공동상속의 경우에는 상속인별로 자유로이 포기할 수 있다. 피상속인의 재산보다 부채가 많다고 판단되는 경우 상속
   포기에 대한 고민을 해볼 수 있다.
    한정승인은 상속인이 상속으로 취득할 재산의 한도 내에서 피상속인의 채무와 유증을 변제할 것을 조건으로 상속을 승인하는 것을
   말한다. 공동상속의 경우에는 상속인별로 자기의 상속분에 따라 취득할 재산의 한도 내에서 그 상속분에 따른 피상속인의 채무와
   유증을 변제할 것을 조건으로 상속을 승인할 수 있다.
    상속 포기 또는 한정승인은 상속 개시된 것을 안 날부터 3개월 이내에 가정법원에 신고해야 한다.

   3) 피상속인 자동차 상속 말소신청 및 그 외 업무
    피상속인의 자동차를 상속받지 않으려면 상속 말소신청을 상속개시일로부터 3개월 이내에 해야 한다. 만약 상속 말소신청을 하지
   않으면 10일 이내에는 10만 원, 그 이후 1일마다 1만 원씩 추가되어 최대 50만 원의 범칙금이 부과된다.

   상속개시일 6개월 이내
    상속개시일인 ‘평가기준일 전후 6개월 이내’에 시가를 확인할 수 있는 다음 시가 인정 사유가 존재해야 한다. 이때, 시가 인정
   사유 판단 기간을 상속세 신고 기간(상속개시일이 속하는 달의 말일로부터 6개월 이내)과 혼동하지 않도록 조심해야 한다.

   상속개시일이 속하는 달의 말일로부터 6개월 이내
    핵심적인 신고 의무로 피상속인의 상속세 신고 및 납부를 해야 한다. 그리고 피상속인의 상속개시일 전까지의 종합소득세 신고도
   필요하다. 그 외 자동차를 상속받기로 하였다면 소유권이전등록 신청 기한이기도 하다.
    상속재산 중 부동산이 있다면 부동산의 취득세 신고 및 납부기한이기도 하다. 상속재산 중 부동산의 비중이 높은 경우가
   대부분이므로 부동산을 상속받을 상속인과 상속 비율에 대해 신중하게 고민해야 한다.
    상속세, 소득세, 취득세 이 세 가지의 세금 납부가 동시에 일어나게 되면 거액의 자금이 필요하므로, 미리 세금의 재원 마련과
   납부 방식에 대한 논의도 상속인 간 협의해야 한다. 이 기간까지 신고 또는 납부되지 않으면 신고불성실 및 납부지연 가산세가
   부과된다.

   상속세 신고기한 이후 9개월 이내
    상속세를 줄이는 여러 공제가 있지만, 핵심은 거주자의 사망으로 인하여 상속 개시되는 경우로 피상속인의 배우자가 생존해 있으면
   최소 5억 원에서 최대 30억 원까지 받을 수 있는 배우자상속공제를 놓칠 수 없다.
    배우자상속공제를 적용받기 위해서는 상속세 신고기한의 다음 날부터 9개월이 되는 날까지 상속인 간 상속재산 협의분할을 통해
   배우자 몫의 상속재산을 분할(등기·등록·명의개서 등을 요하는 경우에는 그 등기·등록·명의개서 등이 된 것에 한함)하고,
   상속재산의 분할 사실을 납세지 관할 세무서장에게 신고해야 한다.
    이 규정의 취지는 배우자상속공제를 받아 상속세를 납부한 이후에 상속재산을 배우자가 아닌 자의 몫으로 분할함으로써
   배우자상속공제를 받은 부분에 대하여 조세회피가 일어나는 것을 방지하고 상속세에 관한 조세법률관계를 조기에 확정하고자 하는데
   목적이 있다. 이때까지 분할이 되지 않으면 분할되지 않은 재산에 대해서는 배우자가 실제 상속받은 금액에 포함할 수 없어서 배우자
   상속공제가 큰 폭으로 줄어들게 된다.
    또한 상속세 신고기한 이후 9개월 이내에는 상속세 결정을 위해 과세관청에서 상속세 조사를 시작하게 된다. 상속세 세무조사는
   거의 모든 경우에서 발생하기 때문에 국세청으로부터 우편물을 받더라도 당황하지 말고 담당 세무사에게 연락하여 세무조사에 임하도록
   하자.
    세무조사 중 기존 사전증여 내역 또는 신고 되지 않은 상속재산이 발견되어 추가 세액이 발생하는 경우가 많다. 추가 세액 납부를
   위해 상속인 간 협의하여 공동계좌에 일정 예금을 넣어둔 후 미래의 상속세를 납부할 수 있도록 대비하는 것도 필요하다.

   1. 상속의 개시, 상속인 확정

   피상속인의 사망으로 상속 개시됩니다. 상속 개시되면 상속재산을 물려 받을 상속인이 확정되는데, 이는 법정상속순위에 따라
   확정됩니다.
--

   법정상속순위

   이 법정상속순위에 따르면, 1순위 상속인은 선순위로서 곧 상속인이 되고, 선순위 상속인이 없을 때는 차순위가 상속인 지위를 갖게
   됩니다.
--

   즉, 1순위 상속인이 존재하면 1순위 상속인만이 상속인 지위를 갖게되고 2순위 이하는 상속인이 될 수 없습니다. 그러나 1순위
   상속인이 없거나 모두 상속포기를 했다면, 2순위가 상속인이 됩니다(3순위, 4순위도 마찬가지 원리).

--

   아울러, 배우자는 1순위 상속인 직계비속(자녀) 또는 2순위 상속인 직계존속(부모)과 각각 공동상속인이 되고, 1,2순위가 모두
   없다면 배우자가 단독으로 상속인이 됩니다.

   (배우자 마저 없을 때 비로소 3순위가 상속인이 됩니다.)

--

--

   상속 개시되었으면, 우선 피상속인이 남긴 상속재산을 정확하게 파악해야 합니다. 피상속인의 예금, 자동차, 부동산 등의
   적극재산과 대출, 카드대금, 체납액 등의 소극재산을 구체적으로 파악할 필요가 있습니다.
--

   사망신고를 하면서 '안심상속원스톱서비스'를 신청하면 수월하게 상속재산을 조회할 수 있습니다. 단, '안심상속원스톱서비스'는 사망
   후 6개월 내에만 신청 가능하고, 이 기간이 지났다면 '상속인 금융거래조회 서비스' 및 '조상땅찾기 서비스' 등을 이용해야
   합니다.

--

   3. 상속포기 여부 결정

   만약 피상속인이 남긴 상속채무가 상속재산을 초과한다면, 상속인은 상속포기 또는 한정승인을 하여 이 상속채무의 변제책임으로부터
   벗어날 수 있습니다. 상속인은 피상속인의 재산 뿐 아니라 채무까지도 물려 받는다는 사실을 꼭 유의해야 합니다.

--

   상속포기를 하면 상속인 지위 자체를 포기하게 되고, 한정승인을 하면 상속재산의 한도 내에서만 상속채무를 변제하는 조건으로 상속을
   승인하게 됩니다.
--

   유의해야 할 점은, 1순위 상속인들이 모두 상속포기를 하면 상속채무가 2순위 → 3순위 → 4순위 순으로 승계되기 때문에,
   상속채무를 청산함으로써 채무가 후순위에게 승계되는 것을 막을 수 있습니다.

   상속을 승인했다면, 상속인들은 상속재산을 분할하게 됩니다. 그런데, 피상속인이 남긴 적법한 유언이 있다면, 오직 이 유언에

   유언이 없다면, 상속인들은 상속재산분할협의를 통해 상속 재산을 나눠갖게 됩니다. 상속재산분할협는 모든 상속인들이 참여해야 하고,
   합의 내용에 전원이 동의해야 유효하게 완료되며, 합의된 내용이 기록된 상속재산분할협의서에 각각 인감날인 및 서명을 해야 합니다.

   5. 상속재산분할심판

   만약 상속재산분할협의를 완료하는 것이 불가능하다면, 상속인은 법원에 상속재산분할심판을 청구할 수 있습니다. 법원의 판결에 따라
   상속재산의 분할 방법이 결정되어 상속재산에 대한 권리, 의무 관계가 확정됩니다.

   6. 상속세 신고 및 납부

   상속재산을 취득한 상속인은 피상속인의 최후주소지를 관할하는 세무서에 상속세를 자진 신고하고 납부해야 합니다. 상속세는 피상속인의
   사망일이 속하는 달의 말일로부터 6개월 내에 납부해야 하는데, 이 기간을 도과하거나 과소신고 등을 한 경우에는 가산세를 부과

   상속세는 인적공제, 물적공제, 일괄공제 등을 적용 받아 많은 부분을 절세 할 수 있으므로, 꼭 사전에 공제 여부를 체크하는 것이

   7. 상속등기

   상속 받은 재산 중 부동산이 있다면, 상속등기를 신청하여 상속인 앞으로 부동산 소유권 명의를 이전할 수 있습니다.

--

   사실, 상속 받은 부동산의 소유권은 상속등기 여부와 관계없이 상속인에게 이전됩니다. 그러나 해당 부동산을 처분하기 위해서는
   반드시 상속등기를 하여 상속인을 소유권자로 표시해야만 합니다.

--

   상속등기 신청 기한은 따로 정해져 있지 않습니다만, 부동산 취득세가 납부되어야 상속등기를 할 수 있기 때문에, 취득세 납부와
   상속등기를 병행하는 경우가 많습니다.

   (취득세 납부 기한 : 피상속인 사망일이 속하는 달의 말일로부터 6개월 이내)

   그러나 상속세는 과세표준을 계산하는 과정에서 공제해주는 금액이 많기 때문에 상속세 대상은 생각보다 많지 않다. 채무가 있으면
   채무도 공제한다.

   상속세를 계산할 때 공제를 해주는 항목은 크게 인적공제와 물적공제로 나눈다. 상속세법에는 각 공제 항목별로 복잡하게 설명되어
   있지만 인적공제의 경우 일괄공제금액 5억원에 미달하면 5억원을 공제하기 때문에 상속재산이 5억원이 넘지 않으면 일단 상속세를
   걱정할 필요는 없다.

   여기에 상속인(유족) 중 배우자가 있다면 배우자 공제액이 최소한 5억원이 추가된다. 따라서 양친부모 중 한 분이 사망하고 한
   분이 남은 상태에서 상속을 받으면 기본적으로 공제되는 금액이 10억원이다.

   몇 년 전까지만 해도 10억원 이상의 재산을 남기고 죽는 사람은 많지 않았고, 상속세는 남의 일이 되었다. 그러나 몇 년 사이에
   수도권을 중심으로 아파트 값이 폭등하면서 상황이 달라졌다.
--
   서울의 경우 아파트 평균매매가는 재작년에 이미 10억원을 넘겼고, 작년 말에는 12억원 중반대를 기록했다. 이제 아파트 한 채만
   남기고 사망해도 절반 이상이 상속세를 걱정해야 한다.

   국세통계상으로도 2020년도 상속세 신고자 수가 2015년도 보다 2배(4,796명→9,555명)나 늘어난 것으로 나타났다. 이
   기간 동안 사망자 증가율은 10%에 불과했기 때문에 상속세 납세인원이 급격히 늘어났음을 알 수 있다. 이제 상속세도 대중화가
   돼가고 있다.

   상속세는 사람이 사망하고 남긴 재산에 대해서 과세하는 것으로 이해하기 쉽다. 그러나 그렇지 않다. 상속세 과세대상은 사망당시의
   실제 상속재산 외에도 사전상속 재산, 간주상속 재산, 추정상속 재산이 있다.

   그러면 사전상속 재산이란 무엇인가? 피상속인의 사망일을 상속개시일이라고 하는데, 상속개시일 이전 10년 이내에 상속인에게 증여한
   재산이 있거나 상속개시일 이전 5년 내에 상속인이 아닌 자에게 증여한 재산이 있으면 이를 사전상속으로 보아 상속재산에 포함한다.

   이 기간 중에 증여를 하고 증여세 신고를 하지 아니하였더라도 상속재산에 포함되며, 증여세 신고를 하고 증여세를 납부한 사실이
   있으면 상속재산에 포함하되, 상속세를 산출한 후에 증여세 납부액을 빼준다.

   최근 아버지의 사망으로 재산을 상속받은 A씨는 과거 9년 전에 아버지로부터 1억원을 금융계좌를 통해서 증여받은 적이 있는데,
   당시에 증여세 신고를 하지 않았다.
--
   금융계좌를 통해서 현금으로 증여를 받는 경우 아주 고액이 아니라면 세무당국에 증여행위가 노출되지 않기 때문에 증여세 신고를 하지
   않더라도 보통 그냥 넘어가는 경우가 많다. 그러나 그러한 증여가 있고 10년 안에 상속 개시되어 상속세 조사를 하게 되면
   10년치의 계좌 입출금 사항을 살펴보기 때문에 그때 비로소 드러나게 된다. 이때는 상속세 조사를 하면서 당연히 증여세를 초과하는
   상속세가 나오면 과세를 하지만 증여 당시에 신고하지 않았던 증여세를 계산하여 가산세까지 따로 매기기 때문에 증여세가 의외로
   많아질 수 있다.

   간주상속 재산은 또 뭔가? 피상속인의 사망관련 보험금이나 피상속인이 신탁한 재산 등을 들 수 있다. 그리고 직장을 다니던 중
   사망을 하였다면 퇴직금 및 공로금, 연금 등 퇴직관 관련하여 받게 되는 수입금액이 포함된다. 다만 유족연금은 제외된다.

   추정상속 재산이란 또 뭔가? 상속개시 전에 재산을 처분하였거나 채무를 부담한 적이 있다면 그 처분재산이나 차입한 자금의 용도가
   불분명한 경우를 말한다. 이는 기간과 규모에 따라 다른데, 사망 전 1년 내에 2억원 이상, 2년 내에 5억원 이상인 경우다.

   이는 사망을 앞두고 상속재산을 줄이기 위하여 특별한 용도가 없이 재산 처분 및 예금의 인출 또는 부채을 일으키는 것을 예방하기
   위한 것이다. 따라서 상속 개시되어 상속세 신고를 앞두고 있다면 적어도 2년 내의 예금인출 등으로 인한 자금을 어떻게
   사용하였는지 검토해보고 소명할 자료를 준비하는 것이 좋다.

   누군가의 사망으로 인해 상속 개시된 경우 상속인은 상속재산을 제대로 파악하는데 어려움이 있을 수 있다. 갑자기 발생하는 사망의
   경우에는 더욱 어려울 것이다. 이럴 때 정부에서 제공하는 「안심상속 원스톱 서비스」를 이용하면 큰 도움을 받을 수 있다.

--

--

   사망일이 속한 달의 말일부터 6개월 이내에 신청할 수 있으나, 상속세 신고를 위한 것이라면 최대한 빨리 해야 한다. 경우에 따라
   상속재산의 평가 및 신고서 작성 등에 수개월의 시간이 소요될 수 있다. 상속세 신고기간도 사망일이 속한 달의 말일부터 6개월
   이내이므로 3~4개월 내에는 상속재산 파악이 이루어져야 한다.

   빚도 상속대상에 포함된다는데, 상속포기, 한정승인 등 해결방법을 알아볼게요.
   빚 상속 해결방법 한정승인, 상속포기, 상속 파산 썸네일

빚도 상속된다!

   부모님이 돌아가시고 난 뒤에 알게 되는 빚이 있다면? 내가 빌린 것도 아닌데 갚아야 하나 고민될 수 있습니다. 부모님의 빚! 즉
   채무는 상속인에게 상속되는 게 원칙입니다. 상속 피상속인의 재산에 관한 포괄적 권리의무가 상속인에게 승계되는 것을 말하는데,
   이 상속재산에는 채무도 포함이 됩니다.

   상속 받고 싶으면 받고, 받기 싫으면 안 받는 의지의 문제가 아니라 법률에 따라 자동으로 진행됩니다. 그렇기 때문에 빚을
   상속받지 않기 위해서는 적극적으로 여러 제도를 활용할 필요가 있습니다

   가족을 잃은 슬픔에 더해 갑작스러운 빚 독촉에 시달리는 이중고를 덜기 위해 고려할 수 있는 방법으로는 상속포기, 한정승인,
   상속재산 파산제도 등의 법적, 사회적 제도를 활용 또는 신용보험을 준비할 수 있습니다. 그럼, 각각의 방법에 대해
   알아보겠습니다.

   CAPTION: 상속승인 관련 제도 이해표 - 구분, 의의/활용 순으로 이루어져있습니다.

      구분                의의/활용
   상속포기      상속인의 지위를 포기, 재산과 채무 모두 상속안함

   신용보험      약정한 보험금으로 상속받은 채무 상환
   (표: 상속포기, 한정승인, 상속재산 파산제도 차이점)

상속포기

   상속 시에 받는 재산보다 채무가 더 많은 상황이 발생할 경우, 상속을 알게 된 후 3개월 내로 상속을 전체적으로 포기할 수
   있습니다. 이를 통해 재산뿐만 아니라 채무도 받지 않게 됩니다. 하지만, 일부만 포기하거나 특정 조건으로 포기하는 것은 허용되지
--

   상속을 포기하면, 다음 순위의 상속인에게 권리와 의무가 이전됩니다. 그렇기 때문에 3개월 내에 모든 상속인들이 순차적으로 상속을
   포기해야 합니다. 상속인은 고인의 유언에 적힌 사람 또는 법에서 정한 순서에 따라 결정됩니다. 피상속인의 배우자는 다른 상속인이
   있을 경우 함께 상속받게 되며, 그렇지 않을 경우 전체를 상속받게 됩니다. 그러므로 상속순위를 파악하고 어디까지 영향을 미치는지
   알아두어야 합니다.

   (삼촌, 고모, 이모 등) 1, 2, 3순위가 없는 경우 상속인이 됨

   한정 승인은 상속받는 재산만큼의 빚까지만 갚겠다는 조건으로 받는 방법입니다. 상속 개시되었음을 알았을 때부터 3개월 안에
   해야하며, 각 채권자들에게 한정승인 허가를 알리고 일간지 공고하는 등 절차가 다소 복잡합니다. 몰랐던 채권자가 나중에 나타날 수
--

   이 방법을 선택하면 상속재산목록을 작성하여 제출해야 하는 등 과정은 상속포기보다 복잡합니다 그렇지만, 상속받을 사람 중 1명만
   한정 승인을 선택해도 상속 절차는 끝납니다. 만약 상속받을 때의 빚이 예상보다 많아서 문제가 생기는 상황이라면, 그 사실을 알게
   된 날로부터 3개월 이내에 특별한 방법으로 한정 승인을 요청할 수 있습니다.(상속인이 상속채무가 상속재산을 초과한다는 사실을
   중대한 과실 없이 알지 못했는데, 이미 단순승인을 한 상황에 처했다면 채무초과상태를 알게 된 날로부터 3개월 이내에 특별한정승인
--

상속재산 파산

   상속포기나 한정승인을 한다는 것은 상속인들이 책임을 면하거나 책임의 한도가 제한되는 것이지, 상속채무 그 자체가 정리되는 건
   아닙니다. 그래서 개인파산 부분에서 상속재산 파산제도가 있습니다.

   상속재산 파산이란, 상속재산으로 피상속인의 채권자, 유증을 받은 자에 대한 채무를 모두 변제할 수 없을 때, 상속재산과
   상속인들의 고유재산을 분리해서 상속재산을 청산하는 절차입니다.

   한정승인 후 상속재산 내에서 채무를 갚게 되는데, 이 채무를 변제하기 위해 상속받은 재산이 모두 사용되거나, 상속받은 재산으로는
   채무 전액을 갚을 수 없는 경우에 상속재산파산 절차가 필요할 수 있습니다. 상속재산파산은 상속받은 재산을 청산하는 공식적인
   절차로, 그 과정에서 파산관재인이 선임되어 재산의 청산 및 채무의 변제가 이루어집니다. 파산신청은 기각될 수도 있으므로
--
   신용보험은 채무가 있는 대출자가 사고로 대출금 상환이 어렵게 된 경우 약정한 보험금으로 대출금을 대신 상환해주는 보험입니다.
   남은 가족에게 채무가 상속되지 않도록 피상속 미리 준비할 수 있는 방법입니다. 보험사가 잔여 대출금을 갚아주기 때문에
   가족들에게 대출을 포함한 집을 물려주지 않아도 되고, 최소한으로 가족들의 보금자리를 안전하게 유지할 수 있습니다.
--

   서울가정법원이 밝힌 통계자료 ‘상속포기 및 상속 한정승인 결정 현황’을 보면 2021년 상속포기 신청 건수가 총 4,106건으로
   역대 최대치였고, 한정승인 신청도 3,803건에 달했습니다.

   대출과 함께 대출상환을 준비하는 방법이기 때문에 나중에 가족이나 자녀에게 빚이 상속될까 걱정할 일은 없습니다. 가족의 보금자리
   마련을 위해 대출 등의 방법을 마련하는 것과 동시에 가족의 보금자리를 계속 지키고 가족의 경제적 부담을 낮추기 위해 대출금을
--
   생전에 신용생명보험처럼 가계 부채가 대물림되지 않도록 미리 대비가 되어 있다면 정말 다행이지만, 아무런 준비 없이 부모가
   사망했다면 먼저 상속재산 유무를 확인하시기 바랍니다. 또, 채무를 갚을 능력이 없다면 상속을 포기할 수 있다는 점도 알아 두면
   도움이 될 것입니다.

   [2023 재계결산-①] ‘경영권 분쟁’ 확인된 LG家 상속소송···승계 전통에 ‘잡음’
     * 주재한 기자(jjh@sisajournal-e.com)
--

   ‘상속 분쟁’ 아닌 ‘경영권 분쟁’···창업 75년 만에 최초 사례
   인용 시 경영권 안정에 타격···제척기간 도과, 분할협의 기망 여부 쟁점
--

   2018년 5월 구본무 선대회장은 와병으로 숨졌다. LG그룹의 설명에 따르면, 구본무 선대회장의 상속재산 중 LG그룹 지주회사
   ㈜LG 등 ‘경영재산’은 구 회장이 상속했다. 구본무 선대회장의 ㈜LG의 주식 11.28% 중 8.76%를 물려받은 구 회장은
   기존에 갖고 있던 주식 6.24%에 더해 15.00%를 지분을 보유하며 최대주주가 됐다.

   반면 남은 상속인들인 세 모녀는 ㈜LG 주식 일부와 구 선대회장의 ‘개인재산’인 금융투자상품, 부동산, 미술품 등 5000억원
   규모의 유산을 받았다. 이 같은 상속 상속인들의 합의에 따라 2018년 11월 완료됐으며, 관련 내용은 세무당국에 신고됐다.

   구 회장과 세 모녀의 갈등이 표면적으로 드러난 시점은 올해 2월이다. 세 모녀가 구 회장을 상대로 상속회복청구소송을 제기한
   것이다. 원칙적으로 상속재산 분할협의는 ‘상속인 전원의 동의’가 있어야 한다. 이러한 절차가 협의로 마무리됐다면 이후 상속 관련
   다툼이 있다 하더라도 상속회복청구소송은 불가능하다.

   그러나 세 모녀는 분할협의서 작성 과정에서 기망행위가 있었다며 소송을 제기한 것으로 확인됐다. 기망행위에 따라 분할협의서 작성은
   무효이고, 법정상속분대로 배우자 및 자녀들이 1.5:1:1:1 비율로 다시 재산을 나눠야 한다는 주장이다.

--

   그동안 세 모녀는 가족 간의 화합을 목적으로 상속 과정에서 있었던 절차상 문제를 바로잡기 위해 소송을 제기했다고 주장해왔다.
   그러나 세 모녀가 경영권까지 염두에 두고 소송에 임했다는 사실이 분명해졌다. 이는 LG그룹의 전통에 균열이 생겼음을 보여준다.
--

   ◇ 소송 요건 충족하나···세 모녀, 상속분할 협의 번복 정황도

   이번 소송의 첫 번째 법률적 쟁점은 제척기간 도과 여부다. 상속회복청구소송은 상속재산을 빼앗겼다는 사실을 알게 된 날로부터 3년
   이내에 제기해야 한다. LG그룹 측은 2018년 11월부터 이미 협의분할이 이뤄졌으며, 이번 소송은 그로부터 4년이 경과해
--
   협의 과정에서의 기망행위가 있어 분할협의를 무효로 볼 것인지는 또 다른 쟁점이다. 세 모녀 측은 구 회장이 경영재산을 받는다는
   유언장의 존재를 믿고 이 사건 상속재산 분할협의서를 작성했으나 유언장은 없었다고 주장한다.

   그러나 세 모녀가 고인의 유지를 충분히 인지했으며 뒤늦게 상속협의를 번복한 정황도 나타난다. 공개된 녹취록에 따르면 김영식
   여사는 구광모 회장에게 “내가 주식을 확실히 준다고 했다”고 말하며 경영재산을 구 회장이 갖는 협의를 인정한다. 그러나 김
--
   김영식 여사의 자필 사인이 담긴 동의서도 세 모녀에게 불리한 정상으로 보인다. 법정에서 공개된 2018년 8월 작성된 한

   민법상 법정상속분에 따라 한 상속지분등기는 차후에 새로운 협의나 심판으로 경정할 수 있다. 그러나 상속재산 분할협의서를 제출해
   한 상속등기는 상속인들의 협의가 전제된다는 점에서 그 무효나 취소를 통해 번복하는 것은 매우 어렵다고 알려졌다.

[상속/조세] 상속재산: 상속의 대상이 되는 재산과 권리를 행사할 수 있는 상속재산

                                    상속재산

--

   정하고 있습니다. 즉 상속 피상속인이 사망하면 즉시 상속재산을 상속받게 됩니다. 이를 법률상 원인이라는 어려운 말로 표현하기도
   합니다. 상속인은 피상속인의 사망을 알았는지 몰랐는지 또는 부동산의 경우 이전등기를 마쳤는지 등에 관계없이 법률상 당연히
   상속재산의 권리를 취득하는 것입니다. 부동산 등기를 하지 않아도 소유권을 갖는 것이죠.


   상속의 대상이 되는 재산을 먼저 보겠습니다. 재산의 종류는 동산, 부동산 외에도 채권 형태로도 나누어 볼 수 있습니다. 각
   종류에 따라 상속재산의 권리를 행사할 수 있는지 살펴보겠습니다.

--
   부동산 매매를 해보지 않았어도 다 알만한 이야기인데요. 부동산을 소유하기 위해서는 부동산소유권이전등기를 받아야 합니다.
   부동산등기가 없으면 소유권을 취득하였다고 인정하지 않는 것은 우리의 법체계입니다. 그렇지만 상속 예외입니다. 부동산을 상속받을
   경우 상속등기를 하지 않더라도 당연히 부동산의 소유권을 갖는 것으로 보기 때문입니다. 따라서 상속등기를 피상속인 사망 후 6개월
   이내에 상속세 신고와 상속등기를 하지 않으면 가산세, 과태료 등의 불이익을 입게 됩니다.

--

   피상속인이 부동산매매계약을 체결하고 등기를 넘겨주기 전에 사망하였다면 상속인은 매수인에 대한 등기의무를 승계하고, 매매대금채권을
   승계받습니다. 그러므로, 매매대금을 청구할 권리가 있고 부동산에 대한 소유권이전등기를 넘겨줄 의무를 지게 됩니다(상속인에 의한
   등기, 부동산등기법 제47조).
--

   가령, 피상속인이 금괴를 금고에 보관해 둔 채로 사망하였다면, 금고에 있는 금괴는 피상속인의 사망시부터 상속인의 소유가 됩니다.
   상속인이 여럿이라면 공동상속 되는 것으로 공동소유관계에 있습니다. 상속재산분할로 단독소유를 정할 때까지는 함부로 처분하면
   문제가 될 수 있습니다.
--

   피상속인이 교통사고로 사망한 경우 피상속인이 가해자에게 청구할 수 있는 재산상 손해 및 정신적 손해에 대한 손해배상청구권을
   승계받기 때문에 가해자에게 직접 손해배상을 구할 수 있습니다.
--
   재산분할의 문제가 없게 되죠. 아이러니라고 할까요? 이혼소송에 이른다는 것이 배우자와의 사이가 좋지 않은 것인데, 이혼소송 중에
   사망하면 생존한 배우자에게 재산은 상속되게 됩니다.

--

   ▶ 피상속인이 보험계약을 체결하고, 스스로를 피보험자 및 수익자로 한다면 어떨까요? 가령 내가 보험계약을 체결하면서 사망으로
   보험금이 지급되는 보험을 체결했는데, 수익자를 자신으로 해둔 경우입니다. 사망했으니 보험금을 받지 못하겠지요. 결국 보험금은
   상속재산이 됩니다. 상속인이 여럿이면 상속인들이 공동상속을 받게 됩니다.


   ▶ 이번에는 피상속인이 자기를 피보험자로 하는 것은 같은데, 수익자를 특정하는 경우입니다. 상속인이 될 사람 중에서 특정할 수도
   있고, 상속인이 아닌 사람을 정해둘 수도 있습니다. 이런 경우라면, 보험금은 상속재산이 아니게 됩니다. 따라서 상속인들은
   피상속인의 사망으로 받을 수 있는 보험금에 대해서 상속재산으로 주장할 수는 없는 결과가 됩니다. 보험금은 보험계약에 따라 받게
   되는 보험수익자의 고유재산이라고 보게 됩니다.
--

   ▶ 피상속인이 자기를 피보험자로 하고, 수익자는 만기까지 자신이 생존하면 자신, 자신이 사망하면 상속인이라고 지정한 경우
   마찬가지로 상속재산이 아닌 상속인의 고유재산이 됩니다. 보험금을 상속인들이 받는 것은 같은데, 이는 상속재산이 아니라 보험계약에
   따라 받게 되는 고유재산인 것입니다.
--

   ▶ 여기서 세법을 좀 살펴야 하는데요. 상속세법에서는 상속인이 여하튼 보험금을 받으면 상속세를 납부해야 하는 재산을 본다는
   것입니다. 따라서 위에서 살펴본 고유재산인 경우에도 상속세를 납부해야 하는 상황이 있을 수 있습니다. 그러면 상속재산으로 보는
   것과 차이가 무엇일까요? 상속세는 납부하지만 상속재산이 아니기 때문에 공동상속인들 사이에서 상속재산분할의 대상이 되지 않는 점이
   차이점입니다. 따라서 공동상속인이 있는 경우 특정 공동상속인 1인이 수익자로서 수령한 생명보험금은 다른 공동상속인과 공유하는
   것이 아닌 단독소유가 됩니다.
--

   ▶ 피상속인이 자기를 피보험자로 하고 상속인 외의 제3자를 수익자로 지정한 경우에는 수익자가 보험사고 발생 전 사망하면 어떻게
   될까요? 보험계약자가 다시 수익자를 지정하지 않고 사망하였다면 보험수익자의 상속인이 수익자가 됩니다.

--

   회사에 대한 주주로서의 권리는 상속재산이 되고, 공동상속들은 상속지분에 따라 나누어 주주권을 소유하게 됩니다. 분할이 불가한
   경우라면 준공유의 형태로 상속 됩니다.

--

   채무 기타 재산적 의무도 상속 됩니다. 피상속인이 적극재산이 전혀 없고 오히려 소극재산만 있다면, 즉 빚만 많이 있는
   피상속인이 사망하면 상속인 빚만도 상속 됩니다. 이런 경우 상속포기 또는 한정승인을 고려해야 합니다. 상속되는 상속재산에는
   채무가 포함되므로, 상속 개시되면 상속인은 상속채무를 갚아야 할 의무를 지게 됩니다. 상속되는 채무가 상속재산보다 많아서
   상속으로 인해 채무초과 상태가 발생하는 경우에는 상속 개시되었음을 알았을 때부터 3개월 내에 상속의 포기를 가정법원에
   신고함으로써 이를 면할 수 있습니다(「민법」 제1019조제1항).
--

   공법상 채무도 상속의 대상입니다. 과태료, 이행강제금, 과징금 등이 대표적인 경우입니다. 형벌의 종류인 벌금은 상속의 대상이
   아닙니다. 피상속인이 생전에 법을 위반하여 부과받은 과징금 채무가 있다면, 이는 대체적 급부가 가능한 의무이므로 상속인에게
   포괄승계된다.
--

   금전채무에 대한 보증채무는 당연히 상속 재산입니다. 그렇지만 보증한도액이 정해진 계속적 보증계약의 경우 보증인이 사망하였다
   하더라도 보증계약이 당연히 종료되는 것은 아니고 특별한 사정이 없는 한 상속인들이 보증인의 지위를 승계하게 됩니다. 그러나
   보증기간과 보증한도액의 정함이 없는 계속적 보증계약의 경우에는 보증인이 사망하면 보증인의 지위가 상속인에게 상속된다고 할 수
   없습니다. 다만, 기왕에 발생된 보증채무는 상속의 대상이 됩니다(대법원 2001. 6. 12., 선고, 2000다47187).</text>

[권오형의 세무상식] 상속재산은 누가, 무엇을 받는가?

--

   상속 피상속인(돌아가신 분)이 남긴 재산과 빚 모두 대상이다. 상속인(배우자와 자녀들)이 유언 또는 민법 규정에 따라 받는다.

   상속의 대상이 되는 재산은 화폐가치가 있는 경제적 자산만이 대상이 된다. 사망한 피상속인에게 부채(빚)가 있는 경우 그 부채도
   상속인에게 상속된다. 재산보다 빚이 많으면 상속포기신청을 해야 하는데 이는 상속개시일(사망일)로부터 3월 내에 관할 가정법원에
   상속포기신고서를 제출토록 규정돼 있다.

   그러나 상속으로 얻은 재산의 한도 내에서 빚을 갚겠다는 조건으로 한정승인 신청서를 제출해 관할 세무서의 승인을 받으면 피상속인의
   모든 빚을 떠맡지 않고 승인받은 범위 내에서 재산과 부채를 상속받을 수 있다.

   유언으로 상속인을 지정한 경우 유언상속 우선하며 유언이 없는 경우에는 민법에 정한 순위에 따른다. 피상속인의 유언이 없는 경우
   직계비속(자녀들)과 배우자는 제1순위자로서 항상 상속인이 된다. 직계비속인 자녀들이 없는 경우에는 직계존속(부모님)과 배우자가
   제2순위자로서 상속인이 된다. 제1순위자와 제2순위자가 없는 경우 형제자매가 제3순위자로서 상속인이 된다. 제1, 2, 3순위의
   상속인이 없는 경우에는 4촌 이내의 방계혈족이 제4순위자로서 상속인이 된다.

   법정상속인을 결정함에 있어서 같은 순위의 상속인이 여러 명이면 촌수가 가장 가까운 상속인을 우선순위로 한다. 촌수가 같은
   상속인이 여러 명이면 공동상속인이 된다. 예를 들어 직계비속으로 자녀 2인과 손·자녀 2인이 있는 경우 자녀 2인만이
   공동상속인이 된다. 손·자녀는 법정상속인 되지 못한다. 상속 순위를 결정할 때 태아는 이미 출생한 것으로 본다. 배우자는
   1순위인 직계비속과 같은 순위로 공동상속인이 된다. 직계비속이 없는 경우 2순위인 직계존속과 공동상속인이 된다. 그러나
   직계비속과 직계존속이 모두 없는 경우엔 배우자가 단독 상속인이 돼 모든 재산을 상속받게 된다.

   상속인이 될 직계비속 또는 형제자매가 상속개시 전에 사망한 경우에는 그 사망한 사람의 순위에 갈음해 상속인이 되는 사람을
   대습상속인이라 한다. 대습원인(상속인이 될 직계비속 또는 형제자매가 사망한 사실 등)이 있어야 한다.

   법에 규정된 상속인이 될 수 있는 자와 없는 자는 다음과 같이 규정돼 있다. 태아, 이성 동복의 형제, 이혼 소송 중인 배우자,
   인지된 혼외자, 양자·친양자·양부모·친양부모, 양자를 보낸 친생부모, 북한에 있는 상속인, 외국 국적을 가지고 있는 상속인은
   상속인이 될 수 있다. 그러나 적모서자, 사실혼(혼인 신고하지 않은)의 배우자, 상속결격 사유가 있는 사람, 유효하지 않은
   양자, 친양자를 보낸 친생부모, 이혼한 배우자 등은 상속인이 될 수 없다고 규정돼 있다. 특히 아무리 오랜 기간을 함께
   살았더라도 혼인신고를 하지 않은 경우에는 배우자의 사망 시 배우자가 남긴 상속재산을 한 푼도 받을 수 없음을 반드시 알아야
   한다. 상속 개시됐을 때 상속인별 몫(상속지분) 유언이 있는 경우(지정상속)와 유언이 없는 경우(법정상속)로 구분된다.

   유언이 있는 경우를 지정상속라 한다. 유언장의 내용에 따라서 몫을 계산한다. 유언은 상대방이 없는 단독의 의사표시로서 사망에
   의해 효력이 발생하는 것이다. 생전뿐 아니라 유언에 의하여 사후의 법률관계의 지배도 인정된다. 그러나 그 내용은 유증, 상속분의
   지정, 유산분할 방법의 지정, 상속인의 폐지·인지 등 법률로써 정한 일정한 것에 한한다. 유언의 방식에는 자필증서에 의한 유언,
   비밀증서에 의한 유언, 녹음에 의한 유언, 공정증서에 의한 유언, 구수증서에 의한 유언 등이 있다. 자필증서에 의한 유언은

   전 세계 신흥 부호 상속받은 돈, 자수성가 부자들 재산 추월

--

   지구촌의 신흥 부호들이 상속을 통해 자수성가형 부호들보다 재산을 더 많이 모으고 있다는 조사 결과가 나왔다.
   미국 CNN 방송 등을 인용한 연합뉴스의 1일 보도에 따르면 전 세계 억만장자의 절반을 고객으로 둔 스위스 최대 투자은행
   UBS는 30일(현지 시각) 보고서에서 이같이 밝혔다.
   이에 따르면 올해 4월까지 1년간 53명의 상속인이 1천 508억 달러(196조 원)를 물려받아 같은 기간 84명의 신흥
   자수성가형 억만장자가 축적한 1천407억 달러(183조 원)를 넘어섰다. ‘

[절세톡톡] 상속재산 양도세 절세, 취득가액을 높이려면

--

   상속재산을 양도할 때 양도세가 고민인 경우가 많습니다. 어떻게 하면 취득가액을 높여서 양도세를 절세할 수 있을까요?

   첫째, 상속세신고를 감정가액으로 하라

   피상속인이 배우자가 있는 상태에서 사망하면 최소 10억(일괄공제 5억 + 배우자 상속공제 5억), 배우자가 없는 상태에서
   사망하면 최소 5억(일괄공제 5억)까지 상속세가 없습니다.

   위 상속공제를 최대한 활용하여 양도세를 절세할 수 있습니다.

   상속세신고를 합니다. 그러면 나중에 동 토지를 매각시 양도세가 없게 됩니다. 취득가액이 상속세 신고가액이 되고 양도가액과
   취득가액이 동일하기 때문에 양도세가 없는 것이죠.

   상속세 과세미달인 경우에만 감정가액으로 신고하는 것이 좋을까요?

   아닙니다. 상속세 부담액과 양도세부담액을 비교하여 실익이 있는 경우에는 상속세를 부담하더라도 감정가액으로 신고하는 것이
   좋겠습니다.
--

   2022년에도 2023년에도, 이후에도 상속재산에 대한 취득세부담액은 개별공시지가를 기준으로 냅니다.

   둘째, 상속개시일로부터 6개월이내 매매계약을 체결하라

   매매금액이 취득가액이 되어 양도소득세는 없고 매매금액을 기준으로 상속세만 내면 됩니다. 당연히 양도세부담과 상속세 부담을
   비교하는 것이 좋겠습니다.
--

   이 경우에도 상속세부담이 늘어날 수 있는데, 양도세 부담액과 비교하여 신청하는게 좋겠습니다.

   세법에서는 부동산의 종류를 따지지 않고 평가기간이 경과한 후부터 법정결정기한 (상속세 과세표준 신고기한부터 9개월, 증여세
   과세표준 신고기한부터 6개월)까지의 기간중에 매매가액, 감정가액 등이 있는 경우 납세자, 지방국세청장, 관할세무서장의 신청 및
   평가심의위원회의 심의를 거쳐 상속세 등을 매매가액, 감정가액 등으로 과세할 수 있습니다.

   평가기간이란 상속개시일 전후 6개월(증여재산의 경우에는 증여일 전 6개월부터 증여일후 3개월)까지를 말합니다.

   상속개시당시를 기준으로 소급감정을 함으로써 양도세를 절세할 수 있을까요?

[생활 속 법률 상식] 한정승인ㆍ상속포기 살펴보고 활용해야

   부모님이 돌아가신 후 남은 재산과 빚은 일반적으로 법정상속인인 자식이 물려받게 된다. 법정상속인은 상속 재산의 규모를 고려하여
   상속, 한정승인, 상속포기 중 하나를 선택할 수 있다. 이 중 부채가 많아 상속포기 혹은 한정승인을 신청해야 하는 경우,
   상속인은 신청 기간은 물론 상속 재산과 사망 보험금의 관계에 대해 알아둬야 한다.

   피상속인의 사망 후 재산 상속 개시되면 그의 재산은 물론 부채(채무) 또한 모두 상속인에게 이전된다. 이때 상속받을 재산보다
   채무가 더 많아 피상속인의 빚이 고스란히 상속인에게 승계돼 곤경에 빠지는 사례도 적지 않다. 대표적으로 드라마 ‘나의
   아저씨’에서 이런 상황을 엿볼 수 있다. 주인공 지안은 엄마의 빚을 물려받은 뒤, 이를 갚기 위해 어린 시절부터 아르바이트를
--

   우리나라 민법은 ‘한정승인’이나 ‘상속포기’ 제도를 두고 있다. 두 가지 다 상속 개시(사망)를 안 날로부터 3개월 안에 법원에
   신청해야 한다. 한정승인은 피상속인의 채무 규모가 얼마나 되는지 알 수 없어 무조건 상속을 포기하기 곤란한 상황일 때 선택하는
   방법이다. 다시 말해 상속을 받기는 하되, 채무에 대해서는 자기가 받은 상속 재산 한도 내에서만 변제 책임을 진다는 의사
   표시다. 상속포기는 상속 자체를 포기하는 것으로, 재산과 빚 모두 물려받지 않겠다는 의미다. 대신 내가 상속을 포기하면, 나
   다음의 후순위 상속인에게 재산과 빚이 넘어간다. 아무런 신청을 하지 않으면 금액과 상관없이 재산과 빚을 모두 부담해야 한다.

   상속받은 빚이 재산보다 많은 것을 3개월의 기간 내에 알지 못하고 단순 승인한 사람을 위한 ‘특별한정승인’ 제도도 있다. 그
   사실을 알게 된 날로부터 3개월 이내에 신청해야 상속 채무에서 벗어날 수 있다. 다만 피상속인 명의의 계좌에서 예금을 단
   1원이라도 인출해 장례비 등으로 사용하면 재산의 임의 처분에 해당돼 상속에 동의한 것으로 간주된다. 이 경우 상속포기나
   한정승인이 제한돼 빚을 떠안을 수 있다.

   상속포기 시 보험금 수령은?

   상속을 포기하거나 한정승인을 신청하면 피상속인의 사망에 따라 보험회사로부터 수령할 수 있는 사망보험금도 함께 사라지는 것일까?
   2003다29463 판결)”고 판시했다. 즉 보험금 수익자인 상속인이 상속을 포기하더라도 수익자는 보험금을 지급받을 수 있다.
   주장하면 제대로 대응하지 못하는 사례가 종종 있다. 그러나 상속을 포기한 상태에서는 어차피 피상속인의 채무를 승계받지 않았으니
   채무 이행을 이유로 강제집행을 할 수 없다.

   대신 보험금과 보험계약에 대한 압류는 별개다. 만약 피상속인이 사망하지 않은 상태라면 피상속인이 계약자인 보험계약도 이 사람이
   소유한 금융 자산이므로 채권자가 그에 대한 채무 이행을 이유로 보험금 압류가 가능하다. 미리 계약자를 변경하는 방법도 있지만
--
   사해행위취소의 소는 채무자가 채권자를 해함을 알고 재산권이 목적인 법률 행위를 했을 때, 그 수익자 또는 전득자에 대한 관계에서
   채무자의 법률 행위를 취소하고 원상회복을 청구하는 일을 말한다. 그러므로 애초에 보험 가입 시 계약자를 배우자나 자녀 등 상속인
   명의로 가입하는 편이 안전하다.
--
   덧붙여 교통사고로 사망해 가해자(상대방) 보험사가 지급하는 고인에 대한 위자료나 장래에 얻었을 것으로 추정되는 수입(일실수입)에
   대한 손해액 등 피상속인에게 지급되는 금액은 상속 재산에 해당된다. 고인이 생전에 가입한 상해·질병보험도 마찬가지로 상속을
   포기하면 보험금을 받을 수 없다. 이때는 보험 가입 시 보험 수익인을 자신이 아닌 법정상속인으로 지정한다 해도 피보험자가 사망
   전에 받을 수 있는 보험금으로 분류되기 때문이다.

    상속란
   상속란 사람이 사망한 경우 그가 살아있을 때의 재산상의 지위가 법률의 규정에 따라 특정한 사람에게 포괄적으로 승계되는 것을
   말합니다.
   상속 피상속인의 사망으로 개시되고 상속인은 피상속인의 재산에 관한 권리의무를 포괄적으로 승계하므로 상속인이 상속을 포기하지
   않는 이상 채무도 승계됩니다.

   상속의 개념
   “상속(相續)”이란 상속개시된 때부터 피상속인의 일신전속권을 제외하고 피상속인의 재산에 관한 포괄적 권리의무가 상속인에게
   승계되는 것을 말합니다(「민법」 제1005조).
   ※ “피상속인(被相續人)”이란 사망 또는 실종선고로 인하여 상속재산을 물려주는 사람을 말하며, “상속인(相續人)”이란 피상속인의
   사망 또는 실종선고로 상속재산을 물려받는 사람을 말합니다.

   √ 상속의 승인·포기기간 내의 상속재산의 관리비용
   √ 상속의 한정승인·포기 시 일정기간의 상속재산 관리비용
   √ 단순승인 후 재산분할 전까지의 상속재산 관리비용
   ※ 이때 상속재산의 관리비용은 상속재산의 유지·보전을 위해 객관적으로 필요한 비용을 말하는데, 상속재산에 소송이 제기된 경우

   ◇ 상속과 유증의 관계
   피상속인이 사망하면서 유증을 하는 경우에는 유증이 먼저 이루어진 후 그 남은 재산으로 상속인이 상속을 받습니다. 만약 남은
   상속재산이 상속인의 유류분에 비해 부족한 경우에는 유류분반환청구를 할 수 있습니다(「민법」 제1112조부터 제1118조까지).

   Q. 피상속인이 자신의 모든 상속재산을 상속인이 아닌 제3자에게 유증한 경우 상속인은 상속재산을 되찾을 수 있나요?


   A. 피상속인이 사망하면 상속인에게 상속 개시되어 피상속인의 상속재산이 상속인에게 포괄적으로 이전되지만, 피상속인이 미리
   유언을 통해 유증한 경우에는 유증의 효력이 발생하게 됩니다. 유증이 있으면 유증을 받은 사람은 유언의 유효를 주장하여 상속인에게
   상속재산을 모두 잃게 되고 맙니다. 따라서 우리 「민법」은 유류분제도를 인정하고 상속재산의 일정부분을 유류분으로 하여 유류분이
   침해된 경우에는 그 침해의 원인이 된 사람에게 이를 청구할 수 있도록 하는 권리를 보장하고 있습니다. 결국 유류분의 한도에서는
   상속인은 상속재산을 되찾을 수 있습니다(「민법」 제1112조부터 제1118조까지).

어머니 상속재산분할시 먼저 돌아가신 아버지 상속재산도 고려되나요

--

   상속분쟁에 대한 상담을 하다보면 많은 분들이 ‘그 상속인은 이미 오래전 돌아가신 아버님(혹은 어머님)의 재산에서 대부분을 먼저
   받았기 때문에 이번 상속과 관련하여서는 유류분 침해 여지를 고려할 필요가 없지 않나요?’라며 반문하십니다.
   부모님이 수십 년 간 공동생활을 하면서 이룩한 재산을 아버지, 어머니 각자의 명의에 따라 나누기보다는 ‘부모님의 유산’이라는
--
   그러나 우리 민법은 부부별산제를 규정하여 아무리 부부라고 해도 각자의 명의에 따라 독립된 재산을 소유하는 것으로 판단합니다.
--

   그런데 얼마 전 대법원은 어머니의 상속재산에 대한 유류분반환청구소송에서 과거 아버지의 상속재산 중 일부를 단독으로 받은 자녀는
   추후 어머니의 재산을 상속받는 과정에서 이를 특별수익으로 고려하도록 판단하였습니다(대법원 2021. 8.

   유류분을 산정하는 기초재산(A)에 합산되어 포함될 것인지와 아버지의 상속재산 중 어머니 지분이 두 아들의 유류분 침해여부 판단에
   있어 특별수익(C)으로 고려되어야 하는지에 대한 부분이었습니다.

   상속재산분할협의의 성질

   이와 관련하여 대법원은 일단 상속재산분할협의의 성질에 대하여 이는 공동상속인 사이에 이루어지는 일종의 계약으로서, 상속
   개시되어 공동상속인 사이에 잠정적 공유가 된 상속재산에 대해서 그 전부 또는 일부를 각 상속인의 단독소유로 하거나 새로운
   공유관계로 이행시킴으로써 상속재산의 귀속을 확정시키는 것이라고 보았습니다.
   또한 사안에서와 같이 어느 공동상속인(어머니)의 취득분을 영(零)으로 하는 상속재산 분할협의도 유효하기 때문에 결과적으로
   공동상속인의 합의에 따라 상속분을 무상으로 양도한 것과 마찬가지가 된다고 판단하였습니다.

   이와 같은 상속분의 무상양도로 인하여 상속재산을 전혀 취득하지 못한 공동상속인은 원래 가지고 있었던 구체적 상속분에 해당하는
   재산적 이익을 취득하지 못하고, 상속재산을 전부 취득한 공동상속인은 원래 가지고 있었던 구체적 상속분을 넘는 재산적 이익을
   취득하게 되어 상속인들 사이 불균등이 발생하므로 유류분 산정의 취지에 따라 과거 아버지의 상속재산 중 어머니의 지분을 유류분
   산정의 기초재산(A)에 포함하고 동시에 이것을 무상양도 받은 아들들의 특별수익(C)으로도 고려하여야 한다고 판단하였습니다.
   어머니가 상속재산 분할협의에 따라 실질적으로 아들들에게 무상으로 양도하였다고 볼 수 있는 아버지 재산에 대한 상속분은 어머니의
   사망으로 인한 상속에서 유류분 산정을 위한 기초재산에 포함되어야 하고, 나아가 아들들의 유류분 부족액에서 아들들이 받은
   특별수익으로서 공제되어야 한다고 판단하였습니다.

   대법원의 판결은 먼저 사망한 아버지의 재산에 대한 상속재산분할협의의 효력이 아버지의 사망 시로 소급하여 어머니가 이것을
   증여했다고 볼 수 없고, 따라서 어머니의 상속재산에 대한 유류분 판단에 있어 이를 고려할 필요가 없다던 원심의 판단을 뒤집은
   것입니다.
   대법원은 상속인간 형평을 위하여 상속재산분할협의의 효력을 실질적으로 판단한 것이라고 보입니다.
   부모님에 유산 상속에 대하여 많은 분들이 가진 궁금증과 아쉬움을 해소하는데 어느 정도 기여한 판결취지라고 여겨집니다.

   재산상속, 호주상속, 상속포기, 단순승인, 한정승인의 간단한 뜻입니다.

상속·상속인·피상속인

   소극재산 : 피상속인이 지고 있었던 채무.

재산상속·호주상속

   1990년 민법 개정으로 호주상속제도가 폐지된 이후 상속라 함은 재산상속을 의미합니다.
   상속등기의 등기원인을 등기부에 기재할 때 이전에는 ‘재산상속’으로 적었지만 개정 이후에는 ‘상속’으로 적습니다.

상속포기·단순승인·한정승인

   상속포기 : 상속을 받지 않는 것입니다. 재산을 일체 승계하지 않습니다.

   : 주권을 상속하는 경우 상속주권반환청구 소송을 제기하는 경우


   : 상속재산인 공유물의 반환청구를 하는 경우(처분행위가 아니라 보존행위에 불과)


   : 피상속인이 피보험자이고, 상속인이 보험수익자가 되어 보험금을 수령, 소비하는 경우(고유재산의 처분에 불과)


   : 상속포기신고 후 협의분할에 의한 상속을 원인으로 소유권이전등기를 하는 경우


   : 상속재산으로 장례비를 지출하는 것(처분행위도 아니고, 이러한 장례비 지출내역을 상속재산목록에 누락한다 하더라도 고의의
   재산목록 불기입으로 볼 수도 없습니다)
--

   : 과실로 상속재산을 손괴하게 한 행위


   2. 상속재산 처분으로 보는 경우

   : 상속인이 스스로 고려기간 내에 상속등기를 하는 경우


   : 상속인이 상속받은 채권을 양도하는 경우(상속채권의 양도와 양도 통지 전에 다른 채권자가 그 상속채권을 가압류하여 그
   가압류결정 정본이 제3채무자에게 도달하여 다른 채권자와 상속인 간의 관계에서 채권양도가 무효-이른바 가압류의 상대적 효력-로
   평가된다 하더라도 상속재산 처분으로 보는 데에는 영향이 없습니다)


   : 한정승인, 상속포기 전에 행한 상속재산의 협의분할(82도2421, 다만 이 사건은 조금 부연설명이 필요합니다. 즉,
   이건에서는 상속인이 실제로는 A부동산을 상속재산분할하기로 협의해놓고, 형식적으로는 상속포기신고를 하여 A부동산을 포기한 것처럼
   행세함으로써 상속세를 면탈하였다가, 나중에 시간이 경과한 후 A부동산에 소유권등기를 경료한 다른 상속인에 대하여 명의신탁 해지를
   원인으로 한 소유권이전등기 청구 소송을 제기하여 의제자백 승소하여 결국 다시 A부동산의 소유권을 가져감으로써, 실질적으로는
   A부동산을 상속받고 그 상속세를 면탈했던 것입니다. 여기서 법원은 등기 경료여부를 불문하고 당초의 상속재산 협의분할 자체를
   단순승인 의제사유인 상속재산 처분으로 보아 상속인이 주장한 상속포기를 무효로 돌리고 조세범처벌법위반으로 처벌하였습니다)


   : 상속인이 피상속인의 제3자에 대한 손해배상채권을 추심하여 변제받은 경우(2009다84936)

   -상속채권을 변제, 수령받은 것도 상속재산 처분행위로 본다는 위 판례에 의할 때, 상속재산인 예금을 수령하는 것에 주의를
   요합니다. 은행예금이란 곧 은행에 대한 소비임치계약에 기초한 예금반환청구권을 의미하는데, 예금을 수령할 경우 그 자체로 상속재산
   처분행위로 판단될 위험이 있습니다. 다만 그 은행예금의 사용이 결국 장례비 등 상속비용에 충당되었다면, 상속재산 처분행위는 되지
   않습니다.
--

   : 고의로 상속재산을 손괴하는 행위


   : 상속채무 변제를 위한 상속재산의 처분(망인의 법무사회 퇴회지급금을 가지고 법무사 사무소 직원의 급여라는 상속채무를 지급한
   행위도 상속재산 처분행위에 해당, 서울중앙지법 2003나52400)

   - 상속인의 사적 이익을 위한 처분인지 여부를 따지는 것이 아니라, 처분 자체를 따지는 것임을 유의해야 합니다.


   3. 상속재산 처분으로 인하여 단순승인이 의제될 경우의 구제방안

   : 상속재산 처분으로 인하여 단순승인이 의제되더라도, 상속채무가 상속재산을 초과한다면, 그 사실을 안 때로부터 3개월 내에
   여전히 특별한정승인이 가능합니다(2003다29562). 이 경우에는 한정승인신청시 기존에 처분한 상속재산도 목록에 제출해야
   합니다.
--

   : 상속인이 상속채무가 상속재산을 초과하는 사정을 알지 못하는 상태에서 상속재산의 일부를 처분하고, 일반한정승인을 신청하여 그
   수리심판이 나온 이후에, 나중에 나타난 채권자가 상속인을 상대로 상속채무의 이행을 구하는 민사소송을 제기하면서, 그 해당
   민사소송에서 상속인이 일반한정승인 신청 이전에 이미 상속재산을 처분하여 단순승인으로 의제되기 때문에 일반한정승인 수리심판이
   무효라고 주장할 경우, 상속인으로서는 비록 일반한정승인 신청에 의하여 수리심판이 나왔지만, 특별한정승인 신청을 했었더라면 적법,
   유효하게 특별한정승인 수리가 되었을 것임을 주장하여 기존의 한정승인 수리심판의 유효성을 주장할 수 있을 것인가?
--
   : 만약 기존의 한정승인 수리심판의 유효성을 배척하게 된다면, 동일한 사실관계에 있어 고려기간 내에 일반한정승인 신청을 던 자는
   상속재산 처분을 이유로 한 단순승인 의제를 이유로 상속을 강요당하는 한편, 고려기간을 지나 채무초과사실을 안 때로부터 3월 내에
   특별한정승인 신청을 한 자는 한정승인이 유효하게 되어 구제받게 되는 불평등한 결과가 발생할 것으로 보인다.</text>

   상속 그 대상에 따라 가계를 계승하는 것과 망자의 재산을 상속하는 두 종류가 있다. 가계계승은 중국의 영향을 받아 초기부터
   적장자단독승계법제가 확립되었다. 그러나 법제와는 달리 제자녀윤회봉사 등의 관습이 존재하였으며,『주자가례』에 따른 적장자단독봉사는
   조선 후기에 사회에 확산되었다. 이는 일제강점기를 거쳐 호주상속·승계로 이어졌으며, 2005년 민법개정으로 2008년에
   폐지되었고, 그 결과 가계계승은 법적 제도로는 이 땅에서 사라졌다. 재산상속 초기부터 존재하였으며, 조선시대에는
   제자녀균분상속 관습이었다. 이는 조선 후기 제사승계의 중시와 향촌사회에서 가문이 중요해짐에 따라 제사를 주재하는
   장자우대상속으로 정착하였다. 이러한 관습은 일제강점기에 더욱 강화되어 1958년 제정된 민법에서도 호주상속인을 우대하였다. 이는
   1977년과 1990년의 개정을 거쳐 남녀균분상속으로 회귀하였다.

--

   재산상속도 사료의 빈곤으로 정확한 내용은 알 수 없지만, 말과 소 등 중요한 재화에 대한 사유재산이 인정되었으므로 재산상속도
   인정되었을 것이다.

고려시대의 상속

   가계계승(家系繼承)은 입사(立嗣)라는 용어로 불리며 상속법을 이루었다. 왕위계승에 관해서는「훈요십조(訓要十條)」에서

   ⑧수양자의 순위로 된다. 공음전시(功蔭田柴)는 5품 이상의 관리에게 수여되었는데, 이는 적장자우선이 아니라 직계남자손, 사위,
   친조카, 양자, 의자(義子)의 순서로 1명이 상속하였다. 또 과거를 거치지 않고 부조(父祖)의 공으로 얻는 음직(蔭職)도
   직계자손, 조카, 사위, 수양자, 내외손의 순위로 1명이 승계하였다.
--

재산상속

   재산상속 단행왕법으로 규정하였으며, 일반적으로는 관습법에 따랐다. 즉, 상속에 관한 분쟁이 있는 경우 재판에서는 관습법을 승인
   또는 수정함으로써 판례법이 형성되었을 것으로 보인다.
--
   고려시대나 조선시대에는 부모가 생전에 유산을 분재하는 생전분재(生前分財)가 원칙이었으며, 그렇지 않거나 누락재산이 있는 경우에는
   부모 사후에 자손이 분재하는 것이 관습이었다. 조상으로부터 물려받은 상속재산인 조업(祖業)은 자손에게 전해야 하며, 이를 함부로
   다른 사람에게 처분하는 것은 불효로 규정하여 법으로 금지하였다. 그래서 상속재산을 가업(家業), 가산(家産), 재산(財産),
   재(財) 등이라고 하였다.
--

   상속인의 순서와 범위는 다음과 같다. ①직계자녀, 딸도 출가여부를 불문하고 아들과 함께 상속하였으며, 자녀가 사망한 경우는
   손자녀가 대습상속(代襲相續)하였다. 자녀에는 수양자녀(收養子女)·시양자녀(侍養子女)도 포함되었다. ②자손이 없는 경우의 배우자인
   남편 또는 아내인데, 아내의 유산은 남편이, 남편의 유산은 아내가 개가(改嫁)하지 않을 것을 조건으로 모두 종신(終身) 동안
   상속하며, 사망 전에 계후자(繼後子)나 수양자녀·시양자녀를 입양하면 이들이 상속하나, 그렇지 않은 경우는 남편과 아내의 유산으로
   분리되어 각자의 본족(本族)이 상속하였다. 본족은 사손(使孫)이라고 하는데, 조부를 공통조상으로 하는 4촌 이내의 자손이다.
   사손, 즉 상속인이 없으면 유산은 국가에 귀속되었다.

   상속재산은 토지·노비·가옥과 동산(動産)이며, 가장 중요해 분쟁이 많았던 재산은 노비였다. 원칙적으로 남녀균분상속었지만,
   토지에 대해서는 전시과(田柴科)제도와 관련하여 이론이 있다. 1046년(정종 12)의 판(判)에 ‘제전정연립(諸田丁連立)’의
   규정인데 전정(田丁)은 앞서 서술한 입사법(立嗣法)과 완전히 같은 순위 즉, 적장자를 우선하도록 규정하고 있다. 이에 대한
   학설은 토지는 적장자와 판(判)에서 규정한 순서에 따라 단독상속하였는데, 고려 중기에 전시과체제의 붕괴와 농장(農莊)의
   성립·확대 그리고 토지의 경제적 가치의 증가 등으로 토지의 사적소유가 확산되었으며, 드디어 고려말의 과전법(科田法) 하에서
   분할상속 공인되었다고 주장하였다. 반대 학설은 고려시대는 초기부터 토지사유제가 확립되어 토지도 자녀균분상속제였으며, 위
   판(判)의 규정은 일반 토지가 아닌 국가로부터 지급되는 토지인 전정(田丁)의 상속순위에 관한 법적 규정일 뿐이라고 한다.

   균분의식이 전제가 된 균분상속제도는 물론 국가가 보장하였다. 부모가 생전분재를 할 경우에도 심히 차별할 수 없었고 사후분재인
   경우도 마찬가지였다. 고려 말에 이르면 불균분상속 때문에 분쟁이 폭주하여 따로 임시재판 관청을 설치하였으며, 그렇지 않은 경우에
   ‘고관평분(告官平分)’하는 것은 실효성 있는 법이요 관습이었다.

조선시대의 상속

--
   계사(繼嗣), 계후(繼後), 입후(立後), 봉사(奉祀)는 모두 제사승계와 동시에 선대(先代)의 인격·신분을 승계하는 것으로
   되었다. 따라서 제사승계 외에 가장권·호주권의 승계라는 관념이 없는 것이 우리나라 신분상속의 특징이었다.

--
   사후봉양을 위탁하는 묘직봉사(墓直奉祀)의 관행이 법적으로 허용되었다. 또 맏며느리인 총부(冢婦)가 남편 사후에 남편을 대신하여
   제사를 승계하는 관습이 있었지만, 가묘 소재 가사의 상속과 관련하여 입후하여 제사를 승계함에 따라 사라졌다.

--

재산상속

   『경국대전』형전(刑典) 사천조(私賤條)에서 노비의 상속에 대해 세밀하게 규정하고 있으며, 이는 토지 등 다른 재산에도
   적용되었다.

   가. 개념: 상속재산은 조상으로부터 물려받은 것으로 ‘조업’이라고 하였다. 조선은 가산제(家産制)가 아니므로 부와 모의 재산은
   각자의 고유재산으로, 상속될 때에도 구분되어, 부변(父邊)전래, 모변(母邊)전래 등으로 표시되었다. 상속재산은 우리 고유용어로
   ‘깃〔衿〕’으로 표현하였는데, ‘깃’은 “남긴다”는 고어인 “기티다”에서 나온 것이며 ‘몫’으로도 사용되었다. 고려와 마찬가지로
   생전분재가 원칙이어서, 부모가 생전에 연로하였을 때나 자녀의 혼인, 과거급제 등 수시로 분재를 하였으며, 그때마다 상속문서인
   분재기(分財記)를 작성하였고, ‘허여(許與)’라고 하였다. 생전분재를 하지 않았거나 이에 누락된 재산에 대해서는 자녀들은 부모
   3년상이 끝난 후에 협의로 분재하였다. 이를 ‘화회(和會)’라고 하였다. 유언의 자유가 어느 정도 인정되었지만, 남녀균분상속의
   관습과 균분의식의 제한을 강력히 받았기 때문에 법정상속(法定相續)이라고 할 수 있으며, 따라서 유류분제도(遺留分制度)는 없었다.

   나. 상속인의 순위와 범위: 상속 “피가 흐르는 곳에 재산이 간다”로 표현되는 혈연상속었다. 혈연상속의 예외로 제사를 지내는
   자에 대해서는 ‘봉사조(奉祀條)’로 상속 인정되었다. 상속인의 순서는 다음과 같다: ①자녀로서 적자녀, 첩자녀, 양자녀이며,
   남녀를 차별하지 않았고 또 부모보다 먼저 사망한 자녀의 자손, 즉 (외)손자녀에게 대습상속 인정되었다. 적자녀에는 제사를
   승계하는 계후자가, 양자녀에는 3세 전의 수양자와 3세 후의 시양자가 포함되었다. ②자녀가 없는 경우 생존배우자이다. 남편은 처
   사후에 처의 유산을 상속한 후, 친자녀에게 다시 상속하였으며, 처는 개가하지 않으면 남편과 같았다. 그러나 배우자의 상속
   종국적인 것이 아니라 처분권이 제한된 종신수익권(終身受益權)이었다. 만약 친자녀가 없는 경우에는 그들의 본족이 상속하였다.
   그러나 유교가 보급되면서 제사가 중요해짐에 따라 자녀 없이 사망한 처의 재산은 그의 본족보다는 봉사자가 상속하는 경우가 후대로
   갈수록 늘어났다. ③배우자나 자녀가 없는 경우에는 4촌 이내의 혈족인 본족, 즉 사손(使孫)이 상속을 하며 그 순서는
   ㉠형제자매, ㉡3촌 조카, ㉢4촌 형제, ㉣3촌 숙부·숙모·고모·이모, ㉤4촌 형제자매이다. ④이러한 상속인이 없으면 상속재산은
   국가로 귀속되어야 하나, 대개는 자녀가 없으면 양자를 들여 재산을 물려주거나, 마을에 재산을 귀속시켜 그 재산으로 제사를
--

   다. 상속분: 상속분은 친자녀 여부, 자녀의 신분 그리고 제사승계의 유무에 따라 달랐다. ①적자녀 사이에는 균등하였으며, 다만
   제사를 승계하는 승중자(承重子)는 봉사조로 1/5을 더 받았으며 또 가묘(家廟)가 있는 집과 제사용 재산을 독점적으로 상속했다.
   제사는 단독으로 승계하기 때문에 제위토(祭位土)도 대개는 승중자가 관리·수익하였다. ②양첩자녀는 적자녀와 1 : 6, 천첩자녀는
   1 : 9의 비율로 상속을 받았다. 그러나 실제로 부는 첩자에 대해 법정비율 이상으로 증여를 하였다. 다만 적자가 없어서 첩자가
   제사를 승계할 때에는 봉사조로 2분을 가급(加給)하여 적녀와 각각 1 : 2, 1 : 3의 비율이었다. 적자녀가 없는 경우에는
   양첩자녀와 천첩자녀는 4 : 1의 비율로 상속을 받았으며, 제사승계인에 대한 봉사조는 적자와 같았다. ③적모와 혈연관계가 없는
   양첩자녀는 전체의 1/7, 천첩자녀는 노비 3구 이내에서 1/9을 상속하고 승중첩자에게는 각각 2분을 가급하였다. 나머지는
   수 없었다. 다만 전모 등에게 자녀가 없으면 의자녀는 본족과 1 : 4의 비율로 상속하였고, 승중의자는 1 : 1로 상속하였다.
   또 자녀가 있어도 부의 승중의자는 자녀와 1 : 8의 비율로 상속하였다. ⑤자녀가 없을 때 수양자녀는 친자녀와 같았고,
   시양자녀는 전체의 1/6을 상속받았으며, 나머지는 본족이 상속하였다. 적자녀가 있으면 각각 1 : 6, 1 : 9로,
   양첩자녀와는 6 : 1, 천첩자녀와는 3 : 2, 수양자녀와 시양자녀는 6 : 1의 비율로 상속을 받았다. 계후자는 친자와 같게
   상속하였으며, 환관(宦官)이 환관을 양자녀로 하였으면 수양자와 동일하게 상속하였다.

   라. 남녀균분상속의 보장: 위 ‘사천조’의 상속규정은 고려시대 이래의 관습을 성문화한 것으로 실효성이 있었다. 그러나 부모
   생전에 허여로 차등이 있었지만, 심하지는 않았고, 만약 유언으로 타인에게 증여한 경우에는 ‘난명(亂命)’으로 그 효력이
   부정되었다. 사후에 화회의 경우에 노비는 성별, 연령, 건강상태 그리고 토지는 지목(地目), 거리, 비옥도 등을 고려한 실질적인
   균분이었다. 불균분을 이유로 한 소송에서는 ‘관작재주(官作財主)’라 하여 관에서 직접 분재를 하였고, 또 상속재산이 침해된
   경우에는 5년의 제소기간(提訴期間)에 구애받지 않고 제소할 수 있었다. 이는 후에는 30년으로 제한되었다. 균분상속 이처럼
   의식과 제도에 의해 강력하게 보장받았다.

유교의 확산과 상속의 변화

--
   제자녀윤회봉사(諸子女輪回奉祀)가 관습이었고, 이는 종손이 5대조 이상의 시제(時祭)만을 담당하고, 부모나 조부모의 제사는
   형제자매들이 돌아가면서 윤번제로 봉사하였다. 이는 시집살이가 아닌 처가살이를 하는 혼속과 남녀균분상속을 바탕으로 하고 있었다.

   이러한 상속의 변화는 16세기 중엽, 반친영제(半親迎制)가 보급되면서 근저에서 변화가 일어나기 시작하였다. 반친영제로
   내외관념(內外觀念)이 생기게 되고 이에 따라 친조부와 외조부를 차별하고 이는 제사에 그대로 반영되었다. 그 결과 딸들과 외손은
   봉사에서 배제되면서 그 반대급부로 재산상속에서 차별을 받았다. 이에 따라 남녀차등상속·제자(諸子)윤회봉사가 성립하였다.
   윤회봉사는 주제자(主祭者)가 확정되지 않았기 때문에 제사를 소홀히 할 우려가 크며 또 제사에는 경제적 부담이 상당하였다. 그래서
   주제자인 장자를 상속에서 우대하면서 제사를 전담하도록 하는 방향으로 전개되었다. 이에는 『경국대전』에 1/5로 규정된 봉사조를
   활용하였다. 그 결과 장자우대상속·장자단독봉사가 성립하였다. 지역과 가문에 따라 다르지만 이러한 장자 중심의 상속·봉사는
   16세기 중엽에 그 단초가 보이기 시작하여 17세기말 18세기초에 일반적인 것으로 되었다.
--
   동성(同姓)촌락이 확산되었으며 지역에서 가문의 위상은 입향조의 현양(顯揚)과 직결되었고 이는 종손의 경제적 규모에 따라
   좌우되었다. 그렇기 때문에 남녀균분상속 더 이상 유지되기 어려웠으며 그 결과 주제자인 종손이 재산을 단독 내지 우대상속하여
   가문의 경제력을 유지하여 가문의 위상을 높일 수 있었다.

일제강점기의 상속

상속법의 법원

   조선총독부는 1912년「조선민사령(朝鮮民事令)」을 공포하여 식민지 조선에서 법원(法源)을 확립하였는데, 원칙적으로 일본민법을
   의용(依用)하면서도 급격한 친족상속관습의 변화는 조선인의 저항을 야기할 것을 우려하여 친족상속에 대해서는 조선의 관습을 법원으로
   인정하였다(제11조). 이후「조선민사령」을 개정하여 상속의 승인이나 상속재산의 분리 등 상속에 관한 기술적인 규정은 의용을
   확대하였다. 따라서 그 이외의 분야에는 관습이 법원이었다. 상속에 대한 분쟁을 해결하기 위하여 통감부시기부터 전국에 걸쳐
   관습조사를 하여『관습조사보고서』를 간행하였으며, 조선총독부 취조국(取調局), 중추원(中樞院) 등에서 지속적으로 관습을
--

상속의 종류

   제사승계와 재산상속 외에, 별도로 호주 지위의 승계인 호주상속제도(戶主相續制度)를 인정하였다. 그러나 봉사(奉祀)는 제사자로
   된다는 뜻에 불과하고 호주제도가 확립됨에 따라, 1933년 3월 3일의 조선고등법원 판결은 “제사승계의 관념은 선대(先代)를
   봉사하며 조상의 제사를 봉행하는 도의(道義) 상의 지위를 승계하는 것에 불과하다”고 판시하였다. 이때부터 제사승계는
   법외(法外)의 관습으로 방치되고, 그 기본적 원리를 호주상속에 적용함으로써 상속 호주상속과 재산상속의 두 종류가 되었다.
   따라서 일반적으로 호주상속인이 제사자로서의 지위도 승계하는 것으로 하였으나, 호주로서 지위의 승계가 반드시 제사자로서 지위의
   승계를 수반하는 것은 아니었다. 이에 따라 예외 없이 호주의 지위를 승계함과 동시에 호주가 소유했던 전 재산도 함께 상속하는
   일본의 가독상속(家督相續) 원리가 이식될 가능성이 있게 되었다. 이는 해방 후 상속법의 기본틀이 되었다.

상속의 개시

   ①호주상속 호주의 사망, 호주의 출계(出繼), 즉 본가(本家)상속, 호주의 파양, 여호주가(女戶主家)의 입양, 여호주가의
   남자출생, 여호주(女戶主)의 출가(出嫁), 여호주의 거가(去家), 차양자(次養子)의 남자출생, 차양자가 호주 가(家)에 입양된
   경우에 개시되었다. ②재산상속 호주상속의 원인이 발생하여 호주상속과 동시에 개시되는 경우와 가족의 사망, 가족의 파양의 경우와
   같이 호주상속과 별도로 개시되는 경우로 나뉘게 되었다.

상속관습법의 변용

   일제강점기 상속 호주상속과 재산상속으로 구성되면, 이는 가족을 토대로 하며 가족은 호적의 정비를 바탕으로 하였다. 호적은
   1909년의「민적법(民籍法)」과 1922년「조선호적령」(1923.7. 시행)으로 정비되었다. 일본민법에서 가(家)는 “호주와
--
   하여 호주상속과 재산상속의 관습은 서서히 일본의 관습에 동화되어 갔다.

   가. 호주상속: 호주상속인의 자격은 제사승계자로 보았으며, 여성은 임시적 호주의 지위를 인정하였다. 그리고 잠정적인 차양자는
   1926년 이후 확정적인 양자로 보았다. 이는 호주의 변동에 따른 법적 불안정성을 제거하기 위한 것이지만, 소목지서에 합당하지
   않는 것이다. 그리고 1917년부터 호주로 된 양자의 파양을 금지하고 상속인의 폐제(廢除)를 인정하지 않았다. 호주상속
   적장자, 적장손, 중자, 서자, 사후양자, 차양자의 순서로 하였다.

   나. 재산상속: 호주상속에서 나타난 특징은 가적(家籍)을 강조하여 원칙적으로 동일가적에 있는 자에게만 상속권을 인정하여 기혼녀의
   재산상속권을 박탈하였다. 호주상속과 연계하여 호주와 가족의 사망을 구분하여 처리하였고, 남녀를 분리하여 관습을 정립한 점이다.
   관습상 인정된 이들의 재산상속권을 박탈하였다. 가장 두드러진 변동은 딸의 재산상속권을 박탈한 것과 장자독점상속화의 기도이다. 또
   상속인에게 아들만 있는 경우의 상속분은 장자가 2/3, 차남이 1/3이고, 형제가 3인 이상인 경우에는 장자가 1/2, 차남
   이하는 1/2분을 균분하며, 서자는 적자의 1/2로 하였다. 더욱이 유산은 장자가 일단 독점상속하고 차남 이하는 호적상
   분가(分家)한 후 분재청구권(分財請求權)을 행사하도록 하였다. 그러나 분가에 대한 동의권은 호주인 장자에게 있으므로, 호주가
   분가에 동의하지 않는 한 차남 이하는 분재청구권을 행사할 수 없게 되어, 사실상 장자가 영구적으로 유산을 독점하였다. 이러한
   관습의 변용은 일본식 호주제도에 따른 장자독점상속을 관철시킴으로써 법의 동화를 촉진하려는 것이었다.

현대의 상속

--
   전에 발생한 사건도 같다. 민법을 제정할 때에 전통을 존중하는 ‘순풍양속론(淳風良俗論)’과 헌법이념에 입각한 ‘남녀평등론’이
   대립되었으나, 전자를 기본으로 하고 후자를 참조하는 보수적 입장에서 절충한 「민법」제5편 상속법이 제정되었다.

   호주와 가족으로 구성되는 가제도(家制度)를 기반으로 하여 호주상속제도와 재산상속을 규정하였다. 호주상속 일제강점기의
   호주상속제도를 그대로 계승하여 규정하였고, 재산상속도 기본적으로는 같다. 상속법은「민법」제정 후 20년 만인 1977년에
   법정상속분에 관한 제1009조가 개정되었고, 유류분(遺留分)제도가 신설되었다. 1990년에 호주상속을 ‘호주승계’로 용어를
   변경하면서 친족법의 일부로 하고, 제정된「민법」에서 호주의 권리를 폐지하여 호주는 가를 대표하는 형식적인 지위에 불과한 존재로
   되었다. 또 재산상속 상속의 유일로 되면서 ‘상속’으로 용어도 개정되었다. 마침내 여성계의 오랜 노력 끝에 호주승계는
   헌법재판소에서 가와 호주제도가 헌법이념과 불합치하다는 결정과 함께 2005년 「민법」(2008.1. 시행)을 개정하여
--

호주상속

   제정「민법」에서는 가를 대표하고 가족에 대한 권리를 갖는 호주는 1인만이 될 수 있으며, 호주상속 남자를 우선하고 여자는
   임시적 지위만 인정하였을 뿐이다. 가의 존속을 강제하기 위해 호주상속 포기할 수 없으며, 호주가 된 양자의 파양을 금지하였다.
   또한 분묘나 금양임야와 묘토, 족보와 제구 등 제사용 재산의 소유권은 호주상속인이 이를 승계하였다. 1990년 개정「민법」에서는
   호주의 권한을 삭제함과 동시에 호주승계를 포기할 수 있도록 하여 이를 임의로 하였다. 그리고 호주상속인이 단독으로 승계한
   제사용재산을 제사를 주재하는 자가 승계하도록 하였다.

재산상속

   일제강점기에 확립된 구관습법을 계승하면서 호주상속제도를 약화시키고여자의 지위를 향상시킨 것이 특징이다. ①호주상속과 재산상속을
   분리하여 생전호주상속의 경우에는 재산상속을 수반하지 않고 재산상속 오직 사망에 의해서만 개시되도록 하였다. ②재산상속인의
   범위는 조선시대에는 4촌까지였고, 일제강점기에는 직계비속, 배우자, 직계존속 및 호주로서 동일 호적 내에 있는 자로 한정하였다.
   그러나 제정「민법」에서는 동일 호적 내의 유무를 불문하고 8촌 이내의 방계혈족까지 확대하였다가 1990년 개정「민법」에서는 4촌
   이내로 축소하였다. ③딸의 상속권을 부활시켰지만 차별을 하였다. 상속분은 제정 「민법」에서는 호주상속인, 아들, 동일 가적 내에
   있는 딸, 동일 가적 내에 없는 딸은 1.5 : 1 : 0.5 : 0.25로 하였으며, 1977년개정「민법」에서는 1.5 : 1
   : 1 : 0.25로, 1990년 개정「민법」에서는 모든 자녀의 상속분을 동일하게 하였다. ④유처의 상속권을 강화하였다. 유처는
   직계비속·피상속인의 직계존속과 같은 순위로 상속인이 되며, 상속분은 제정「민법」에서는 직계비속과 공동상속하는 경우 남자 상속분의
   1/2, 남편의 직계존속과 공동상속하는 경우 남자와 균등하며, 직계존속도 없는 경우 단독 상속하도록 하였다. 1977년
   개정「민법」에서는 직계비속과 공동 상속하는 경우에는 아들의 상속분의 5할을 가급하고, 직계존속과 공동상속하는 경우에는 직계존속의
   상속분의 5할을 가급하게 하였다. ⑤혼인 외의 출생자인 서자녀(庶子女)는 재산상속에서 혼인 중의 출생자와 차별하지 않았지만,
   2005년 호주제 폐지 이전에 호주상속순위는 혼인 중의 출생자인 남자가 우선하도록 하였다. ⑥1977년 개정「민법」에서는
   유류분제도를 신설하여, 직계비속 등 상속인의 권리를 보호하였다. ⑦1990년 개정「민법」에서는 공동상속인 중에 피상속인의 재산
   유지 또는 증가에 관하여 특별히 기여하거나 피상속인을 특별히 부양한 자에 대해서 우대하는 ‘기여분제도’를 마련하였다. 또한
   상속인이 없어서 상속재산이 국가에 귀속되기 전에 피상속인과 생계를 같이 하거나 요양간호를 한 자 등 피상속인과 특별한 연고가
   있던 자에 대해서도 상속재산의 분여를 인정하는 ‘특별연고자 분여제도’를 신설하여, 상속에서 실질적 합리성을 도모하였다.
   (BUTTON) 접기/펼치기 현대 상속제도의 변화와 의미

   상속제도는 역사에 바탕을 두고 변화하였다.「민법」에서도 호주상속과 재산상속을 규정하였는데, 호주상속 조선시대에 확립된
   제사승계법제가 일제강점기를 거치면서 강화되고 법으로 확립되었으며, 결국 남녀평등을 규정한 헌법이념에 불합치하는 것으로 선언되어
   폐지되었다. 재산상속 고려시대부터 조선 중기까지 남녀균분상속었으며 조선시대에는 법적으로도 강력하게 보호를 받았다. 그러나
   조선 후기 반친영제의 확산으로 내외관념이 생겨 친가와 외가를 차별하기 시작했으며 아울러 제사를 받들 승중자의 중시로 그러한
   균분상속 관념이 변화하였다. 이러한 변화는 독립적인 것이 아니라 서로 연계되면서
   “솔서혼속(率壻婚俗)·남녀균분상속·제자녀윤회봉사→반친영례·남녀차등상속·제자윤회봉사→반친영례·장자우대상속·장자단독봉사” 순으로
   변천하였다.

   현행 상속법의 토대를 이루는 것은 일제강점기에 확립된 상속관습이다. 이는 호주의 강력한 권한을 바탕으로 하고 있는 전전(戰前)
   일본민법의 영향을 강하게 받은 것이다. 하지만 일반적 강요 내지 동화정책 만으로는 가족관습을 변화시킬 수 없다. 따라서 이
   변화에는 조선사회 내부에서 진행되어온 자체의 변화도 무시할 수 없다. 조선 후기의 상속관행과 주제자의 지위는 일본의 호주와
   유사할 정도로 강력하였다. 일제강점기 일본적 상속관습의 형성 내지 확립은 이전의 사회적 토대가 있었기 때문에 큰 저항 없이
   가능하였다. 그렇다고 해서 일제강점기의 경험이 의미가 없는 것은 아니다. 그 이전의 관습은 단순한 사실에 불과할 뿐 제도는
--

   현행「민법」에서는 가부장제에 바탕을 둔 가와 호주제도가 폐지되었고, 재산상속에서도 남녀평등이 규정되었다. 이제 개인을 바탕으로
   한 가족과 상속제도가 제도적으로 안착되었으므로 향후 남녀평등을 실질적으로 실천하는 일이 중요한 과제로 남게 되었다.

   고인이 사망하면 상속절차가 뒤따른다. 상속 사망 당시 피상속인 본국법에 따른다. 피상속인이 한국 국적을 가진 경우 상속인이
   외국 국적을 가지고 있다고 하더라도 피상속인의 국적법인 한국법에 따라 상속절차가 진행되는 것이다.

   본격적으로 상속 개시되면 상속 순위와 상속 대상, 유언장 유무, 피상속인의 재산상태 조회, 상속포기 및 한정승인 여부 등 여러
--

   민법 제 1000조에 따라 상속 순위는 ① 피상속인의 직계비속 ②피상속인의 직계존속 ③ 피상속인의 형제자매 ④피상속인의 4촌
   이내의 방계혈족으로 정해진다. 피상속인 법률상 배우자는 1순위 상속인 등과 공동상속인이 된다.

   법무법인 두우 심보문 상속변호사는 “상속 개시 당시 상속인인 자는 태아, 이성동복 형제, 이혼 소송 중인 배우자, 인지(認知)된
   혼외자, 양자, 친양자, 양부모, 친양부모, 북한에 있는 상속인 등을 모두 포함한다”며 “특히 외국 국적을 가진 상속인도 상속
   순위에 있는 상속인으로 본다”고 설명한다.

   즉 해외 거주자 역시 상속인이 될 수 있는 것이다. 다만 상속순위와 관련해 한 가지 더 유의할 사항은 ‘대습상속’과 관련한
   부분이다.

   대습상속인이란 ‘상속인이 될 직계비속 또는 형제자매(피대습인)’ 등 상속 순위에 있는 자가  상속개시 전에 사망하거나 결격자가
   된 경우 사망하거나 결격된 사람의 순위에 갈음하여 상속인이 되는 ‘피대습인의 직계비속 또는 배우자’를 의미한다.

   예컨대 A씨의 아버지가 사망했고, 최근 할아버지가 사망한 경우, 할아버지의 상속인은 A씨의 아버지다. 하지만 상속인이 될 A씨의
   아버지가 사망했기 때문에, A씨가 아버지의 상속 순위에 갈음하여 할아버지의 상속인이 되는 것이다. 즉 A씨가 대습상속인이 되는
   것.

   심보문 변호사는 “대습상속 대습 원인, 대습자로서의 요건을 갖추어야 한다”며 “또한 동순위 공동상속인과 갈등이 생길 여지가
   있다”고 설명한다.

   이어 “해외에 거주 중이면서 대습상속인 자격을 갖춘 경우 다른 공동상속인에게 부당하게 상속 재산을 빼앗길 가능성이 있는
   것”이라고 우려를 표한다.

   해외거주 대습상속인도 상속 순위, 재산 정리, 반출 등 가능

   때문에 법무법인 두우 심보문 변호사는 해외거주 대습상속인의 막막한 현실을 충분히 공감하며, 대습상속 자격 확인부터 공동상속인간
   필요 없게 현지에서 상속을 마무리할 수 있도록 돕는 것도 이같은 이유에서다. 그 결과 법무법인 두우에는 해외거주자 상속 관련
   의뢰가 끊임없이 이어진다는 것.

   심보문 변호사는 “대습 상속인이 국내에 없어도 안심하고 상속 정리될 수 있도록 필요할 때마다 진행 상황을 보고 한다”며 “특히
   해외거주자의 경우 상속세, 상속 등기 등 필수 서류가 국내 상속인과 다른 부분이 있고, 상황에 맞는 추가 제출 서류도 다를 수
   있어 꼼꼼하게 처리한다”고 말한다.
--

   또한 해외거주 상속인이 이전받을 상속재산이 있다면 재산 유형에 따라 필요한 서류, 이전 절차, 신고 후 재산 반출까지, 법적
   문제가 없도록 도움을 주고 있다.

   의뢰인의 상황을 적극 공감하고 가능한 한 모든 조력을 제공하는 심보문 상속변호사가 상속 분야에서 독보적으로 주목받는 이유다.</text>

   이 글을 참고하여 망자가 가족들을 위해 남겨둔 재산을 잘 정리하도록 하자. 특히 상속세 신고 및 납부기한은 상속개시일(사망일)이
   속하는 달의 말일부터 6월이 되는 날까지여서 6개월 이상 여유가 있으니 급할 것 없다고 생각하는 상속인이 있다. 그러나 한 달
   사항이 많으며, 오히려 상속세 신고기한인 6개월은 충분한 검토를 하기에 짧을 수 있다.

    2) 안심상속 원스톱서비스(사망자 등 재산 조회 서비스)
    안심 상속 원스톱서비스는 사망신고 시 상속의 권한이 있는 자가 사망자의 재산조회를 통합 신청할 수 있게 하여 사망 처리 후속
   절차의 번거로움을 없애고 상속 관련하여 신속한 대처가 가능하도록 편의를 제공하는 제도다. 대부분 사망신고를 위해 시·군·구청
   또는 주민센터 방문 시 피상속인의 ‘안심 상속 원스톱 서비스’를 동시에 진행한다.
    신청 전 유념할 사항은 해당 서비스 신청을 하게 되면 피상속인의 금융재산 인출 거래가 정지된다는 점이다. 추후 금융재산에
   대하여 공동상속 인간에 협의 분할을 한 후에는 정식으로 인출이 가능하지만 협의 분할 전에 지급해야 할 자동이체 서비스 등은
   인출되지 않기 때문에 연체에 대한 불이익을 받을 수 있다. 그러므로 급한 자금이 있다면 미리 인출한 후에 사망신고 및 안심상속
   원스톱 서비스를 신청하는 것이 좋다.

   3) 금융감독원 상속인금융거래조회 서비스
    상속인이 피상속인의 금융재산 및 채무를 확인하기 위하여 무작정 금융회사를 일일이 방문하는 것은 시간적·경제적 어려움이 있다.
   이를 덜어주기 위하여 금융감독원에서 조회신청을 받아 각 금융회사에 대한 피상속인의 금융거래 여부를 확인할 수 있는 서비스다.
   안심 상속 원스톱 서비스의 정보를 토대로 좀 더 상세 내역을 확인할 수 있다.

   4) 고정지출 내역 정리
    건강보험, 신용카드, 통신비용 등 피상속인의 이름으로 되어 있는 각종 고정 지출사항을 정리하자. 휴대전화와 집 전화기는
   피상속인의 채권·채무 관계를 확인하는 데 필요할 수 있으므로 우선 해지를 미루는 것이 좋으며, 피상속인이 사업장이 있는 경우에는
   사업자등록에 대해서도 상속인 간의 협의에 따라 사업장 승계자가 달라질 수 있으므로 상속재산 협의가 어느 정도 마무리된 이후에
   진행하는 것이 좋다.

부모재산상속 에 관한

--

1. ‘상속’ 이란 무엇인가?

   ‘상속’의 법적 의미는 사람이 사망하여 그의 재산상 법률관계가 상속인에게 포괄적으로 승계되는 것 입니다. 즉, 부모재산상속란
   것은, 부모님이 돌아가시면 재산상 법률관계가 자녀들에게 승계되는 것을 말합니다.

   기억해야 할 점은 부모님의 재산 뿐 아니라, 채무도 또한 상속된다는 것입니다. 따라서 상속재산보다 상속채무가 더 많다면,
   상속인은 자신의 재산으로 상속채무를 변제해야 합니다. 이렇게 채무가 상속되는 것을 방지하기 위한 방법이 바로 상속포기 및
   한정승인 입니다.

2. 피상속인?  상속인?

   돌아가신 분이 피상속인이고, 재산을 상속 받는 사람이 상속인 입니다.

   상속인이 되는 조건은 피상속인과 일정한 혈연관계가 있어야 하는데, 민법 제1000조의 상속순위 규정에 따라 상속인이 결정됩니다.

   [상속순위]

   1순위 : 피상속인의 직계비속 + 피상속인의 배우자

   2순위 : 피상속인의 직계존속 + 피상속인의 배우자

   3순위 : 피상속인의 형제자매

   4순위 : 피상속인의 4촌 이내의 방계혈족

   피상속인이 사망함으로써 상속 개시된 후, 상속재산은 상속인들이 분할하여 받게 됩니다.

   문제는 상속재산분할 방법을 결정하는 것인데, 이는 유언 → 상속재산분할협의 → 상속재산분할심판 의 순으로 결정됩니다.

   즉, 피상속인이 사망하기 전에 적법한 유언을 남겼다면, 이 유언의 내용에 따라 상속재산이 분할됩니다. 그러나 유언이 적법하지
   않거나, 유언을 남기지 않았다면, 공동상속인들의 상속재산분할협의에 따라 분할방법이 결정됩니다. 상속인들은 법정상속분에 따라
   분할을 결정할 수도 있지만, 임의로 분할방법을 정할 수도 있습니다. 가령, 특정 형제에게 더 많은 상속분을 주는 결정을 할 수도
   있습니다.

   상속재산분할협의는 모든 공동상속인들이 참여해야 하고, 결정된 사항에 모두가 동의해야 합니다. 일반적으로, 결정된 사항은
   ‘상속재산분할협의서’에 작성하고, 전원이 인감 날인을 해야 합니다. 그런데, 모든 상속인들이 협의에 참여하는 것이 불가능하거나,
   분할방법에 대한 합의를 도저히 할 수 없는 경우가 있습니다. 이와 같은 상황에서는 상속재산이 계속해서 분할되지 않게 되므로,
   특정 상속인이 상속재산을 임의로 등기하거나 처분하는 등의 행위를 할 수 없습니다. 결국 상속인들은 상속재산을 받을 수 없어
   시간적인 낭비가 발생하고, 상속세 신고 기한이 경과하면 가산세까지 부과 될 수 있으므로 비용적인 낭비도 발생하게 됩니다.

   이렇게 상속재산분할협의가 완료 될 수 없다면, 상속인은 법원에 상속재산분할심판을 청구 할 수 있습니다. 상속재산의 분할방법
   결정을 소송을 통해 결정하는 것입니다.

   다음 3단계로는 재산상속에 관한 절차들을 진행하여야 합니다.

   민법 규정에 따른 상속인, 법정상속분을 확인한 다음, 상속재산 조회결과를 바탕으로 각 상속인별로 구체적 상속지분을 결정하는
   상속재산분할이 이루어져야 하고, 이에 따라 등기·등록 명의 변경과 상속세 등 조세공과금의 납부 등이 이어집니다.

   아직까지 우리 사회에서는 상속인들간의 협의에 의해서 상속재산분할이 원만하게 이루어지는 경우가 많지만, 협의가 이루어지지 않거나
   상속인 중 일부를 찾을 수 없는 경우라면 가정법원을 통하여 상속재산분할심판을 거치게 됩니다.

   그런데 위와 같은 경우는 상속재산이 존재하는 경우에만 해당되는 이야기입니다. 실제로는 상속인들이 상속재산을 확인해보면 별다른
   재산이 없고 오히려 대출금을 비롯한 부채가 발견되어 당황하는 경우가 많습니다. 이런 경우 상속인들은 상속포기 또는 한정승인을
   통해서 부모빚을 대물림하지 않을 수 있습니다. 이와 관련하여 상속포기의 요건, 기간, 방식, 제출서류, 주의사항 등을 전반적으로
   설명드리겠습니다. 더불어 아래에 상속포기신고서 양식, 상속포기기간연장신청서 양식을 첨부하였으니 필요하신 분들은 다운로드 받아서
   사용하시면 됩니다.

   상속포기란

   상속포기는 상속인이 상속의 효력을 소멸하게 할 목적으로 하는 의사표시를 말하며, 가정법원에 상속포기의 신고를 합니다(민법
   제1041조).

   상속인으로서의 일체의 자격을 포기하는 것이므로 상속재산 전부의 포기만이 인정되고, 일부 또는 조건부 포기는 허용되지 않습니다.
   또한 상속포기시 첨부한 상속재산목록에 포함되어 있지 않은 상속재산에도 상속포기 효력이 미칩니다(대법원 95다27554 판결).

   상속포기를 하면 상속의 효과가 상속의 개시시에 소급하여 확정적으로 소멸되고(민법 제1042조), 상속을 포기한 상속인은 처음부터
   상속인이 아니었던 것과 같은 지위에 놓입니다. 따라서 상속인은 상속채무를 면하게 됩니다.

   상속포기를 할 수 있는 자

   민법 1000조에 규정된 아래의 상속인에 해당하는 이상, 상속순위를 가리지 않고 누구나 가능합니다.

--

   피상속인의 직계비속 + 피상속인의 배우자

--

   피상속인의 직계존속 + 피상속인의 배우자

--

   피상속인의 형제자매

--

   피상속인의 4촌이내의 방계혈족

   상속인이 여러 명인 경우 각 상속인들은 다른 공동상속인들과는 별도로 혼자서 상속포기 신고를 할 수 있습니다. 다른 공동상속인들이
   상속을 포기하든 한정승인을 하든 아무 관계가 없이 각자 자신의 상속 지분에 대해서 포기 신고를 하면 되는 것입니다. 물론 간이한
   처리를 위해서 일부 상속인이 함께 신고하거나, 전원이 함께 신고하는 것도 가능합니다.

   다만 주의해야 할 점은 선순위 공동상속인 전부가 상속포기를 하면 안 된다는 것입니다. 선순위 상속인 중 일부만 상속을 포기하면
   그 상속분은 다른 상속인에게 상속비율에 따라 귀속되지만, 선순위 상속인 전원이 상속을 포기하면 다음 순위 상속인에게 상속되고,
   다음 순위 상속인도 다시 상속을 포기하면, 그 다음 순위 상속인에게 상속됩니다. 따라서 선순위 공동상속인 중 적어도 1명은
   상속포기를 하지 않고 한정승인을 해야만 상속관계를 전부 조기에 종결시키고 후순위 상속인에게로 상속문제를 떠넘기지 않을 수
   있습니다.

   그리고 이 때 한정승인을 하는 1명은 피상속인(고인)의 배우자가 아니라 피상속인(고인)의 직계비속(자녀) 중에서 선정하여야
   합니다. 배우자는 모든 직계비속, 직계존속이 존재하지 않는 한 단독으로 상속할 수 없고 직계비속 또는 직계존속과 함께 공동으로만
   상속하기 때문입니다. 예컨대 피상속인(고인)의 배우자가 한정승인을 하고 자녀들은 모두 상속포기를 한다면, 배우자가 1차적으로
   상속재산을 전부 상속하고 2차적으로 한정승인의 효력이 발생하는 것이 아니라 1차적으로 배우자는 피상속인(고인)의 손자녀들과
   공동으로 상속한 후 단지 배우자의 상속분에 한하여 한정승인의 효력이 발생하는 것이므로, 피상속인(고인)의 손자녀들이 상속 사실을
   알지 못하다가 나중에 뒤늦게 알면서 당황하여 법정기한을 놓치는 경우가 종종 발생하고 법정기한을 지키더라도 손자녀들이 별도로 다시
   상속포기나 한정승인 절차를 밟아야 하는 불편이 생기므로, 피상속인(고인)의 자녀들 중 1명이 한정승인을 해야 모든 상속관계가
   간명하게 정리됩니다.
--

   상속포기는 상속순위를 가리지 않고 가능하기 때문에 선순위 상속인들이 상속포기를 하기 전에 후순위 상속인들이 먼저 상속포기를 하는
   것도 가능합니다. 현실적으로 형제나 그의 가족들, 사촌이 언제 상속포기를 하였는지 파악하는 것은 쉽지 않기 때문에 후순위
   상속인들 입장에서는 상속채무가 걱정되는 경우 선순위 상속인들의 상속포기 여부를 기다리지 말고 먼저 상속포기를 하는 것이
   안전합니다.
--

   상속포기의 방식

   상속포기를 신고할 때에는 신고서에 하자가 없도록 주의를 기울여야 합니다. 신고서에 추후 보완할 수 없는 흠이 있는 등의 사유로
   신고가 결국 수리되지 아니하였고, 그 사이에 상속포기기간이 도과하였다면 그 신고를 기준으로 상속포기기간을 준수하였다고 인정하여
   주지 않기 때문입니다(대법원 2003스32 결정).

   상속포기기간

   상속포기는 상속인이 상속개시가 있음을 안 날로부터 3개월 내에 가정법원에 신고를 마쳐야 합니다(민법 제1019조 제1항,
   제1041조). 3개월의 숙려기간이 도과하면 법정단순승인한 것으로 간주되어 상속인은 더이상 한정승인이나 상속포기를 할 수 없게
   됩니다(민법 제1026조 제2호).

   ⦁ “상속개시가 있음을 안 날”

   “상속개시가 있음을 안 날”은 고인의 사망사실을 알고, 자기가 상속인이 된 사실도 안 날을 의미합니다(대법원 91스1 결정,
   대법원 86스10 결정, 대법원 74다163 판결, 대법원 69다232 판결).

   선순위 상속인 전원이 상속을 포기하여 차순위 상속권자가 상속인이 된 경우에 차순위 상속권자는 고인의 사망사실 뿐 아니라 선순위
   상속권자들이 전원 상속을 포기하여 자기가 상속인이 되었다는 사실을 안 날로부터 기산합니다(대법원 2013다48852 판결,
   대법원 2013다15869 판결, 대법원 2012다59367 판결, 대법원 2003다43681 판결).

   다만 상속재산의 유무, 상속포기제도의 존재 등은 이를 알지 못하였더라도 상속포기기간이 진행됩니다.

   ⦁ 상속인이 여러 명인 경우

   상속포기기간은 각 상속인별로 개별적으로 진행합니다.

   ⦁ 상속인이 제한능력자인 경우

   상속인이 제한능력자인 경우에는 그의 친권자나 후견인이 제한능력자를 위한 상속개시가 있었다는 사실을 안 때부터 진행합니다(민법
   제1020조).
--

   상속재산의 상태가 명백하지 않아 상속재산의 전체 규모와 내용을 조사하여 파악하는 데 상당한 기간이 필요한 경우 등과 같이 3개월
   내에 상속의 승인 또는 포기의 의사결정을 하기에 곤란한 경우에는 가정법원에 3개월의 고려기간 연장을 청구할 수 있습니다(민법
   제1019조 제1항 단서). 이와 관련하여 상속포기기간 연장신청서 양식은 첨부파일을 확인하시면 됩니다.

   상속포기신고를 하고나서 상속재산을 정리하는 차원에서 차량 폐차, 중고물품 매도, 채권 추심 등을 하는 경우가 종종 있습니다.
   상속인이 상속포기신고를 하였더라도 아직 이를 수리하는 가정법원의 심판이 고지되지 않아 상속포기효력이 발생하기 이전에 상속인이
   상속재산 일부라도 처분, 소비하게 되면 단순승인을 한 것으로 간주됩니다(민법 제1026조 제1호, 대법원 2013다73520
   판결). 그 후 상속포기심판을 받았더라도 상속포기는 무효가 됩니다. 따라서 상속포기를 통해 상속채무를 승계하지 않기를 원한다면
   상속포기심판이 고지될 때까지 상속재산을 처분하지 않도록 주의하여야 합니다.

   또한 상속인이 상속포기신고를 한 후에 상속재산을 은닉하거나 부정소비하는 경우에도 법정 단순승인이 되므로(민법 제1026조
   제3호) 마찬가지로 주의를 요합니다.

   상속포기각서의 효력

   부친이 자신이 운영하던 회사를 사후에 경영권 다툼 없이 장남에게 물려주기 위해서 생전에 나머지 자녀들에게 일부 재산을 증여하는
   대신 상속포기각서를 받는 등으로 고인의 생존시에 일부 상속인들이 상속을 포기하기로 약정하는 경우가 종종 있습니다.

   그러나 상속의 포기는 상속 개시된 이후 일정 기간에만 가능하고 가정법원에 신고하는 등 일정 절차와 방식을 따라야 유효한
   것이므로, 상속개시 전에 한 상속포기약정은 위와 같은 절차와 방식에 위반되어 무효입니다(대법원 94다8334 판결, 대법원
   98다9021 판결). 따라서 부모님 생전에 상속포기각서를 작성했더라도 부모님의 사망 이후 상속권을 주장할 수 있고, 다만 생전
   증여받은 재산을 특별수익으로 반영하여 상속분을 산정하게 됩니다.

--

   한편 부모님 사망 이후에는, 상속재산분할 협의 과정에서 다른 공동상속인 전원에 대하여 자신의 상속분을 포기한다는 의사를
   표시하거나 상속포기각서를 작성한다면 상속재산분할협의로서 효력이 발생할 수 있습니다.

대습상속

--

   이제까지는 상속에 관해서 비교적 쉽고 간단한 내용들만 말씀드렸는데, 오늘은 조금 복잡하고 어려운 내용을 말씀드리려고 합니다.
   바로 대습상속라는 겁니다.

--

   상속법적으로 설명하면 원래 상속인이 되어야 할 사람이 상속 일어나기 전에 사망하거나 상속결격자가 되어서 상속을 받을 수 없는
   경우에 그 사람의 직계비속(쉽게 말하면 자녀 또는 손자녀)이나 배우자가 그 사람을 대신해서 상속을 받는 것을 말합니다.

--

   이러한 상황에서 부친이 사망하면 상속 개시됩니다. 그리고 원래는 A, B, C, D가 상속인이 되어야 합니다. 그런데 상속인이
   되려면 상속 개시될 당시에 생존해 있어야 합니다. 그러나 B는 부친이 사망할 당시에 생존해 있지 않았으므로 상속인이 될 수
   없습니다. 따라서 A, C, D만이 상속인이 됩니다. 그런데 대습상속으로 인해 B의 배우자와 자녀가 B를 대신해서 상속을
   받습니다. 이것이 바로 대습상속입니다.


   만일 B가 부친보다 먼저 사망하지 않았다면 B가 부친의 유산을 상속받고 그 뒤에 B가 사망하면 B의 배우자와 자녀가 B의 유산을
   상속받았을 것인데, 대습상속을 인정하지 않으면 B가 부친보다 먼저 사망했다는 우연한 사정이 끼어들었다고 해서 부친의 유산
   상속관계가 달라지는 것은 상속인들(A, B, C, D)사이에 공평하지 않기 때문에 대습상속을 인정하는 것입니다.

--

   다음으로 민법에서 인정하는 대습상속의 요건에 대해 말씀드리겠습니다.

   대습상속 상속인이 될 피상속인(돌아가신 분)의 직계비속이나 형제자매가 피상속인보다 먼저 사망하거나 상속결격자가 되어야
   합니다(민법 제1001조, 이 글에서는 먼저 사망한 경우만 말씀드립니다). 민법 제1000조에 의하면 상속인이 될 사람으로는
   직계비속과 형제자매 이외에도 직계존속(부모 또는 조부모, 외조부모), 4촌 이내의 방계혈족도 있습니다. 그러나 직계존속이나 4촌
   이내의 방계혈족에게는 대습상속 일어나지 않습니다.

   대습상속을 할 수 있는 사람은 먼저 사망한 사람의 배우자나 직계비속(자녀, 손자녀)입니다. 앞에 있는 그림에 나온 사례에서
   부친이 사망하기 전에 B가 먼저 사망하였는데, B의 처가 B 사망 후 재혼을 하였고 그 뒤에 부친이 사망하였다면 어떻게 될까요?
   이때도 B의 처가 전 남편인 B를 대신해서 대습상속을 받을 수 있을까요? 민법 제775조 제2항에 의하면 부부 중 한 사람이
   사망한 경우 생존 배우자가 재혼한 때에는 인척관계가 끝납니다. 남편이 사망했더라도 처가 재혼을 하지 않고 있으면 시댁과의
--
   처가 재혼을 함으로써 처는 더 이상 B의 배우자가 아니고, B의 집안에서 며느리가 아닙니다. 그러므로 재혼한 B의 처는 B를
   대습상속하지 못합니다.

   다시 말씀드리지만 대습상속을 할 수 있는 사람은 먼저 사망한 사람의 배우자나 직계비속입니다. 그런데 사실혼 관계에 있는 배우자와
   그 배우자가 임신한 태아는 어떻게 될까요? 그림에 나온 사례에서 B는 사실혼 관계에 있는 처가 있었고, B가 사망할 당시 사실혼
--

   먼저 상속법에서 말하는 배우자란 모두 법률상의 배우자를 말합니다. 즉 법적으로 혼인신고가 되어 있는 배우자만이 배우자이고,
   사실혼 관계에 있는 사람은 배우자가 아닙니다. 따라서 사실혼 관계에 있는 사람은 어떤 상속도 받을 수 없습니다. 다음으로
   민법에서는 태아는 상속순위에 관해서는 이미 출생한 것으로 봅니다(민법 제1000조 제3항). 따라서 사실혼 관계에 있는 처가
   임신한 태아는 B의 부친(태아의 할아버지)이 사망할 경우 B를 대신해서 상속을 받을 수 있습니다.

   그리고 대습상속 일어나기 위해서는 상속인이 될 사람이 피상속인 보다 먼저 사망해야 한다고 말씀드렸는데, 만일에 피상속인과
   상속인이 될 자녀가 동시에 사망하였다면 어떻게 될까요? 예를 들어서 부친이 있고 부친의 상속인이 될 사람으로는 1순위로 딸이
   한명 있고 그 다음 순위로 부친의 형제자매가 있다고 가정해 봅니다. 그리고 딸은 결혼을 해서 남편은 있으나 아직 자녀는
   없습니다. 그런데 부친과 딸이 비행기를 타고 가다가 비행기 추락사고로 동시에 사망하였다면 어떻게 될까요? 만일 딸이 부친보다 단
   1초라도 늦게 사망했다면 부친의 사망으로 딸에게 상속 일어나고, 다시 1초 후에 딸의 사망으로 다시 딸의 상속인인
   남편(사위)에게 상속 개시되어 사위가 부친의 재산 전부를 상속 받게 됩니다. 반대로 딸이 부친보다 1초라도 먼저 사망하고 그
   뒤에 부친이 사망했다면 전형적인 대습상속으로 역시 딸의 배우자인 사위가 딸을 대신해서 부친의 재산을 전부 상속받게 됩니다.

   이 규정 때문에 앞에서 든 사례에서 부친과 딸은 동시에 사망한 것으로 추정이 되는 것입니다. 만일에 대습상속의 요건인
   “피상속인이 사망하기 전”이라는 요건을 엄격하게 적용하면 딸은 부친이 사망하기 전에 사망한 것이 아니므로 대습상속 일어날 수
   없고 또 딸이 부친의 상속인이 되려면 피상속인이 사망할 때 생존하고 있어야 하므로 딸은 부친의 상속인도 될 수 없습니다. 그에
   따라 부친의 재산은 딸보다 후순위 상속인인 부친의 형제자매가 상속을 하게 됩니다.

   결론적으로 말씀드리면 피상속인과 상속인이 동시에 사망한 경우에도 대습상속 일어납니다. 앞서 든 사례는 대법원 2001. 3.
   9. 선고 99다13157판결의 사례를 제가 간단하게 줄여서 예로 든 사례입니다. 대법원은 앞에서 가정한 것처럼 딸이 부친보다
   먼저 또는 뒤에 사망한 경우에는 사위가 부친의 재산을 상속할 수 있는데, 동시에 사망한 것으로 추정되는 경우에만 아무런 상속을
   받을 수 없다는 것은 현저히 불공평하고 불합리하다는 이유로 대습상속을 인정하였습니다. 그 결과 부친의 재산은 사위가 전부
   물려받았고, 부친의 형제자매들은 전혀 상속을 받지 못했습니다. 다만 위 판결에서는 사위가 부친의 형제자매들보다 우선하여 단독으로
   상속하는 것이 반드시 공평한 것인지 의문을 가져볼 수는 있다고 여운을 남기기는 했습니다.

   한편 상속인이 상속을 포기한 경우에는 대습상속 인정되지 않습니다.

   대습상속을 하면 대습상속인의 상속분은 얼마나 될까요?

   대습상속 먼저 사망한 사람을 대신해서 상속을 받는 것이므로 먼저 사망한 사람이 받을 몫만 대습상속합니다. 앞에 있는 그림의
   예에서 B가 먼저 사망함으로써 B의 처와 자녀가 대습상속을 할 경우를 예로 들어보겠습니다. 부친의 자녀인 A, B, C, D의
   법정상속분은 동일하므로 4명은 4분의 1씩 부친의 재산을 상속받습니다. 그런데 B가 부친보다 먼저 사망함으로써 B가 상속받을
   몫인 4분의 1을 B의 처와 자녀가 대습상속을 합니다. B의 처와 자녀 사이에서는 처가 1.5, 자녀는 1의 비율로 대습상속
   받은 4분의 1을 나누어 가집니다. 가령 자녀가 2명이라면 1.5 : 1 : 1의 비율로 나누어 가집니다.

   그런데 A씨는 사망하기 전에 한국에 있는 아파트와 미국에 있는 병원 건물 등 모든 재산을 아들인 Y에게 상속한다는 유언장을
   작성했습니다. 이 유언장은 뉴저지주법에 따라 작성된 것이었습니다. A씨가 사망하고 Y가 A씨의 전 재산을 상속받은 경우, C는
   Y를 상대로 유류분반환청구를 할 수 있을까요?
--
   글로벌 시대가 도래함에 따라 한국 뿐 아니라 다른 나라에도 재산을 소유한 사람들이 점차 늘어나고 있습니다. 특히 미국에 거주하는
   사람들 중에는 한국에 부동산을 보유한 경우가 많은 편입니다. 이들이 사망하면 어느 나라 법에 따라 상속 이루어질까요?

   이는 준거법(governing law)의 문제입니다. 미국의 상속법과 한국의 상속법이 다르기 때문에 준거법이 어디냐의 문제는
   상속인들의 이해관계에 미치는 영향이 매우 큽니다. 예컨대 미국에서는 유류분제도가 존재하지 않는 반면 한국에는 '유류분제도'가
   있습니다. 따라서 만약 미국 거주자가 자녀 중 한 사람에게만 모든 재산을 유증한다는 유언을 남기고 사망했다면, 유증을 받지 못한
   상속인 입장에서는 한국법이 적용되어야만 유류분반환청구를 할 수 있게 됩니다.

   뉴저지주 역시 유류분제도가 존재하지 않습니다. 따라서 전처의 딸인 C가 Y를 상대로 유류분반환청구를 할 수 있으려면 A씨의
   상속에 관해 한국법이 적용돼야 합니다. 국제사법에 따르면, 상속에 관한 준거법은 피상속인의 사망 당시 본국법에 의하도록 되어
   있습니다(제49조 1항). 따라서 피상속인 A씨의 국적인 한국법이 적용돼야 합니다.

   그런데 국제사법에서는, 피상속인이 유언에 의하여 명시적으로 '피상속인의 상거소가 있는 국가의 법'을 지정한 때에는 상속 그
   국가의 법에 의하도록 규정하고 있습니다(제49조 2항). 여기서 ‘상거소’라 함은, 상시 거주하는 장소(Habitual
   Residence)를 의미하는 것입니다. 이번 사건에서 A씨는 줄곧 뉴저지주에서 거주해왔기 때문에 A씨의 상거소는
   뉴저지주입니다. A씨는 뉴저지주법에 따른 유언장을 작성했으므로, A씨의 상속에 관해서는 한국법이 아닌 뉴저지주법이 적용된다고 볼
   여지가 있습니다. 그렇게 되면 결국 이 사건에서 전처 딸인 C는 한국법의 적용을 받지 못해 유류분청구를 할 수 없게 됩니다.

   하지만 준거법은 이해관계인들에게 미치는 영향이 매우 크고, 국제사법은 상속에 관해서는 원칙적으로 피상속인의 본국법을 따르도록
   규정하고 있습니다. 만약 피상속인의 본국법을 따르지 않고 상거소지법을 따르고자 한다면 이를 객관적으로 분명하게 명시해야만 효력이
   있는 것으로 보고 있습니다.
--
   따라서 어느 나라 법이 적용될 것인지에 관해 명시하지 않은 채, 단순히 뉴저지주법에 따라 유언장을 작성하면서 전 재산을 Y에게
   상속한다고만 적은 경우에는 원칙으로 돌아가서 A씨의 본국법인 한국법이 적용되게 됩니다. 그럴 경우 C는 Y를 상대로 유류분청구를
   할 수 있을 것입니다. 결국은 A씨의 유언에 대한 해석(어느 나라 법을 준거법으로 지정했는지)이 관건이라 할 수 있습니다.</text>

[the L]화우의 웰스매니지먼트팀 전문가들이 말해주는 '상속·증여의 기술'

--
   # 올해 80세인 A씨는 슬하에 아들 2명이 있고, 재산은 시가 약 10억원 상당의 부동산과 예금 약 10억원을 갖고 있다.
   최근 A씨는 재산 상속을 두고 고민이 깊어졌다. 평소에 효도를 더 많이 하는데 경제 사정은 상대적으로 어려운 장남에게 많은
   재산을 물려주고 싶지만, 이 경우 형제간 다툼이 벌어질 것 같아서다. A씨가 원하는 대로 장남에게 더 많은 재산을 물려주는 것이
   가능할까?
   A씨의 사례에서 부모가 원하는 대로 자식들에 차등해 재산을 물려주면 되는 것 아니냐고 생각할 수 있다. 하지만 민법은 상속인들이
   상속 재산 중 일부를 받을 수 있도록 보장하고 있기 때문에 피상속인의 의사대로 상속재산을 차등해서 물려주는 데에는 한계가 있다.
   이처럼 민법에 따라 상속인들에게 보장되는 최소한의 상속재산을 '유류분'이라고 한다. 때문에 피상속인이 특정 상속인의 유언이 더
   많은 재산을 남겨주라는 내용이더라도, 나머지 상속인들이 받아야 할 유류분을 침해하지 않는 범위 내에서만 효력이 있고 그 범위를
   넘을 경우에 유언은 효력이 없다.
   민법이 규정하는 유류분을 구체적으로 살펴보면 피상속인의 직계비속과 배우자는 법정 상속분의 1/2, 피상속인의 직계존속과
   형제자매는 법정 상속분의 1/3이다.
   구체적인 액수는 상속 개시 당시 피상속인의 재산가액에 상속 개시 전(피상속인 사망 전)에 이뤄진 증여재산가액을 더하고 채무를 뺀
   금액에 유류분 비율을 곱하는 방식으로 산정한다.
   상속인들끼리 유산을 두고 벌이는 법적 다툼은 대부분 유류분 반환청구 소송이다. 유류분보다 적은 재산을 물려받게 된 상속인이
--
   소송을 내는 것이 대부분이다.
   상속인들 사이에 생길 수 있는 법정 분쟁을 방지하려면 특정 상속인에게 더 많은 재산을 물려주더라도 다른 상속인의 유류분은
   침해하지 않도록 해야 한다.
   A씨의 경우 채무나 사전증여가 없을 때 상속재산이 총 20억원이고 상속인들인 형제의 법정상속분은 각각 상속재산의 1/2인
   10억원이다. 유류분은 법정상속분의 1/2인 5억 원이다. 따라서 A씨는 차남에게 최소 5억원은 물려줘야 사망 이후 형제 간
   분쟁을 막을 수 있다.
   유류분은 당초 특정 상속인이나 제3자에게 유산이 몰리는 것을 방지해 유족들의 생계를 보호하기 위해 도입됐다. 그러나 최근에는
   전통적 가족 개념이 바뀌고 있고 피상속인의 재산 처분권을 지나치게 침해한다는 지적이 나오면서 일각에서는 유류분 제도를 폐지해야
   한다는 주장도 제기된다.
   유류분 제도가 정비되기 전까지는 상속인들간 분쟁을 방지하기 위해 유류분을 침해하지 않는 선에서 피상속인이 원하는 대로 차등해
   물려주는 것이 현실적인 방안이다.</text>

가업상속공제, 증여세 과세특례 등 확대로 가업승계 기반 마련···
세대를 이은 기업경영 확산 기대
--

--

   올해초부터 가업승계 대상 확대(4→5천억원), 상속공제 한도 상향(500→600억원), 증여세특례 한도
   증액(100→600억원), 증여세 저율 과세 확대(30억 이하 10%→60억 이하 10%) 등 상속세 및 증여세 과세특례가 대폭
   개선되어 가업승계시 과세 부담을 줄였다.
--

   가업승계는 안정적 일자리의 근원으로 가업승계 기업이 과중한 상속세 부담으로 성장이 둔화되거나 문을 닫는 것보다, 조세부담을
   완화하여 투자를 활성화하고 고용을 확대하는 것이 장기적으로는 바람직하기 때문이다.

   가업승계가 단순한 ‘부의 대물림’이라는 인식이 있으나, 큰 노력 없이 물려받은 자산을 유지·증식하는 일반상속과 기업 성장·유지
   성과가 근로자, 거래처 등에 분배되고 국가경제의 성장으로 이어지는 가업승계와는 큰 차이가 있다.</text>

   알기 쉬운 상속제도 및 상속세 해설 2022.7

--
   Ⅰ. 글의 첫머리에
   예전과 달리 요새는 인심이 각박해져서 그런지, 부모의 재산을 놓고 형제들 간에 상속 분쟁이 늘어나고 있다. 형제들끼리 서로 많은
    재산을 상속받으려고 하고, 변호사를 선임해서 소송까지 불사한다. 무척 안타까운 일이다.
   상속분쟁을 막으려면, 부모 입장에서 생전에 유언장을 잘 작성해서 공증을 받아놓는 것이 필요하다. 하지만 일반인은 이러한 유언제도
   나 유언공증제도에 대해 잘 모르기 때문에, 구두로 자녀들에게 유언을 하거나, 자필로 유언장을 써놓아도 요건에 맞지 않아 무효가
   되기도 한다.
   부모가 유언장을 작성해 놓은 사실을 자녀들에게 알리지 않고 있다가 돌아가면, 나중에 적게 상속을 받거나, 아예 상속을 받지 못하
   게 된 자녀들은 법에 따라 유류분청구소송을 하게 된다.
   상속 법률의 규정에 의하여 자연인의 재산법상의 지위가 그 사망 후에 특정인에게 포괄적으로 승계되는 것을 의미한다. 민법
   제5편(제977 내지 제1118조)은 상속라는 표제 아래 법정상속, 유언 및 유류분에 관하여 규율하고 있다. 민법은 상속
   개시되면 상속인이 바로 피상속인의 재산에 관한 포괄적인 권리와 의무를 승계하는 것으로 규정하고 있다. 상속으로 인한 법률관계를
   신속하게 확정함으로써 법적 안정성을 도모하기 위함이다.
   여기에서는 상속에 관한 법을 알아보고, 일반인들이 알아야 할 몇 가지 사항에 대해 대법원 판례를 중심으로 살펴보기로 한다. 특히
    상속분과 상속의 포기, 상속재산분할의 협의, 유류분, 상속세에 관해 알아본다.

--

   Ⅱ. 상속재산
   상속인은 상속 개시된 때로부터 피상속인의 재산에 관한 포괄적 권리의무를 승계한다. 재산에 관한 것이 아닌 권리의무는 승계하지
   않는다. 피상속인의 일신에 전속한 것은 그러하지 아니하다.
   금전채권과 같이 급부의 내용이 가분인 채권은 공동상속되는 경우 상속개시와 동시에 당연히 법정상속분에 따라 공동상속인들에게 분할되
   어 귀속된다. 상속개시 당시에는 상속재산을 구성하던 재산이 그 후 처분되거나 멸실·훼손되는 등으로 상속재산분할 당시 상속재산을
   구성하지 아니하게 되었다면 그 재산은 상속재산분할의 대상이 될 수 없다.
   상속인이 그 대가로 처분대금, 보험금, 보상금 등 대상재산을 취득하게 된 경우에는, 대상재산은 종래의 상속재산이 동일성을
   유지하면서 형태가 변경된 것에 불과할 뿐만 아니라 상속재산분할의 본질이 상속재산이 가지는 경제적 가치를 포괄적·종합적으로
   파악하여 공동상속인에게 공평하고 합리적으로 배분하는 데에 있는 점에 비추어, 대상재산이 상속재산분할의 대상으로 될 수는
   있다(대법원 2016. 5. 4.자 2014스122 결정).
   상속재산 분할의 대상이 될 수 없는 상속채무에 관하여 공동상속인들 사이에 분할의 협의가 있는 경우라면 이러한 협의는 민법
   제1013조에서 말하는 상속재산의 협의분할에 해당하는 것은 아니다. 분할의 협의에 따라 공동상속인 중의 1인이 법정상속분을
   초과하여 채무를 부담하기로 하는 약정은 면책적 채무인수의 실질을 가진다.
   상속재산 전부를 상속인 중 1인인 을에게 상속시킬 방편으로 그 나머지 상속인들이 상속포기신고를 하였으나 그 상속포기가 기간을
   초과한 후에 신고된 것이어서 상속포기로서의 효력이 없더라도, 을과 나머지 상속인들 사이에는 을이 고유의 상속분을 초과하여
   상속재산 전부를 취득하고 나머지 상속인들은 그 상속재산을 전혀 취득하지 않기로 하는 의사의 합치가 있었다고 할 것이므로 그들
   사이에 위와 같은 내용의 상속재산의 협의분할이 이루어진 것이라고 보아야 한다.
   피상속인이 명의신탁을 하여 둔 재산에 대하여 그 수탁자에게 증여의제 규정이 적용되어 증여세가 부과될 수 있다고 하더라도, 그
   재산이 신탁자인 피상속인의 소유에 속한 것이라는 실질에는 변함이 없으므로, 그 재산은 피상속인의 사망시 당연히 상속재산에
   속한다고 보아야 한다(대법원 2004. 9. 24. 선고 2002두12137 판결).
   피상속인은 유언으로 상속재산의 분할방법을 정할 수는 있지만, 생전행위에 의한 분할방법의 지정은 그 효력이 없어 상속인들이 피상속
   인의 의사에 구속되지는 않는다. 협의에 의한 상속재산의 분할은 공동상속인 전원의 동의가 있어야 유효하고 공동상속인 중 일부의 동
   의가 없거나 그 의사표시에 대리권의 흠결이 있다면 분할은 무효이다.
   상속재산에 대하여 그 소유의 범위를 정하는 내용의 공동상속재산 분할협의는 그 행위의 객관적 성질상 상속인 상호간의 이해의 대립이
    생길 우려가 있는 민법 제921조 소정의 이해상반되는 행위에 해당하므로 공동상속인인 친권자와 미성년인 수인의 자 사이에 상속재
   산 분할협의를 하게 되는 경우에는 미성년자 각자마다 특별대리인을 선임하여 그 각 특별대리인이 각 미성년자인 자를 대리하여 상속재
   산분할의 협의를 하여야 한다(대법원 2001. 6. 29. 선고 2001다28299 판결).
   Ⅲ. 공동상속과 상속분
   상속인들의 상속순위는 다음과 같다. ① 제1순위 - 피상속인의 직계비속, ② 제2순위 - 피상속인의 직계존속, ③ 제3순위 -
   피상속인의 형제자매, ④ 제4순위 - 4촌 이내의 방계혈족
   배우자는 직계비속 또는 직계존속과 동순위로 상속인이 되고, 직계비속이나 직계존속이 없는 경우에 형제자매나 4촌 이내의 방계혈족에
    우선하여 단독상속인이 된다.
   제4순위의 상속인은 피상속인의 3촌부터 4촌 이내의 방계혈족이다. 3촌으로는 백숙부와 고모, 외삼촌과 이모 및 조카들이 있다.
   4촌으로는 종형제자매, 고종형제자매, 이종형제자매 등이 있다. 방계혈족 가운데에도 최근친이 선순위가 되고, 촌수가 같으면 수인이
   면 공동상속인이 된다.
   상속인이 수인인 때에는 상속재산은 공유로 한다. 임대인의 지위를 공동상속한 경우 공동상속인의 임대차보증금반환채무는 불가분채무가
   된다. 상속분은 공동상속의 경우에 각 공동상속인이 차지할 몫을 말한다.
   동순위의 상속인이 수인인 경우에는 그 상속분은 균분으로 한다. 피상속인의 배우자가 직계비속 또는 직계존속과 공동으로 상속하는
   때에는 그 직계비속 또는 직계존속의 상속분의 5할을 가산한다. 민법 제1008조는 공동상속인 중에 피상속인으로부터 재산의 증여
   규정한다. 이를 보통 특별수익의 반환이라고 한다. 특별수익자는 공동상속인 중에서 증여 또는 유증을 받은 자이다.
   민법 제1008조는 공동상속인 중에 피상속인으로부터 재산의 증여 또는 유증을 받은 특별수익자가 있는 경우에 공동상속인들 사이의
   공평을 기하기 위하여 그 수증재산을 상속분의 선급으로 다루어 구체적인 상속분을 산정할 때 이를 참작하도록 하려는 데 그 취지가
   있다.
    공동상속인 전원에 대하여 상속으로 인한 소유권이전등기를 신청하여야 한다(대법원 2013. 8. 22. 선고 2013다30882
    판결).
   민법 제1011조 제1항은 “공동상속인 중 그 상속분을 제3자에게 양도한 자가 있는 때에는 다른 공동상속인은 그 가액과 양도비용
   을 상환하고 그 상속분을 양수할 수 있다.”고 규정하고 있는바, 여기서 말하는 ‘상속분의 양도’란 상속재산분할 전에 적극재산과
   소극재산을 모두 포함한 상속재산 전부에 관하여 공동상속인이 가지는 포괄적 상속분, 즉 상속인 지위의 양도를 의미하므로, 상속재산
   을 구성하는 개개의 물건 또는 권리에 대한 개개의 물권적 양도는 이에 해당하지 아니한다(대법원 2006. 3. 24. 선고 20
   06다2179 판결).
   대습상속, 상속인이 될 직계비속(제1순위의 상속인)이나 형제자매(제3순위의 상속인)가 상속개시 전에 사망하거나 상속결격으로 된
    경우에, 그 상속인이 될 자의 직계비속(1001조) 및 배우자(1003조 2항)가 원래 상속인이 될 자 대신에 상속을 하는 것
   을 말한다(1001조).
   대습상속제도는 대습자의 상속에 대한 기대를 보호함으로써 공평을 꾀하고 생존 배우자의 생계를 보장하여 주려는 것이다. 동시사망 추
   정규정도 자연과학적으로 엄밀한 의미의 동시사망은 상상하기 어려운 것이나 사망의 선후를 입증할 수 없는 경우 동시에 사망한 것으로
    다루는 것이 결과에 있어 가장 공평하고 합리적이라는 데에 입법 취지가 있다.
   상속인이 될 자가 직계존속인 때나, 4촌 이내의 방계혈족인 때에는 대습상속 인정되지 않는다. 상속포기의 경우에는 대습상속
   인정되지 않는다. 민법 제1001조의 ‘상속인이 될 직계비속이 상속개시 전에 사망한 경우’에는 ‘상속인이 될 직계비속이
   상속개시와 동시에 사망한 것으로 추정되는 경우’도 포함한다. 피상속인의 자녀가 상속개시 전에 전부 사망한 경우 피상속인의
   손자녀는 본위상속 아니라 대습상속을 한다(대법원 2001. 3. 9. 선고 99다13157 판결).
   상속재산의 분할은 상속 개시된 때에 소급하여 그 효력이 있다. 그러나 제3자의 권리를 해하지 못한다(민법 제1015조). 이는
   상속재산분할의 소급효를 인정하여 공동상속인이 분할 내용대로 상속재산을 피상속인이 사망한 때에 바로 피상속인으로부터 상속한 것으로
   보면서도, 상속재산분할 전에 이와 양립하지 않는 법률상 이해관계를 가진 제3자에게는 상속재산분할의 소급효를 주장할 수 없도록
   함으로써 거래의 안전을 도모하고자 한 것이다.
   상속재산인 부동산의 분할 귀속을 내용으로 하는 상속재산분할심판이 확정되면 민법 제187조에 의하여 상속재산분할심판에 따른 등기
   없이도 해당 부동산에 관한 물권변동의 효력이 발생한다. 다만, 상속재산분할심판에 따른 등기가 이루어지기 전에 상속재산분할의
   효력과 양립하지 않는 법률상 이해관계를 갖고 등기를 마쳤으나 상속재산분할심판이 있었음을 알지 못한 제3자에 대하여는
   상속재산분할의 효력을 주장할 수 없다(대법원 2020. 8. 13. 선고 2019다249312 판결).
   상속재산분할의 대상이 되는 상속재산의 범위에 관하여 공동상속인들 사이에 분쟁이 있을 경우에는 한정승인에 따른 청산절차가 제대로
   이루어지지 못할 우려가 있는데 그럴 때에는 상속재산분할청구 절차를 통하여 분할의 대상이 되는 상속재산의 범위를 한꺼번에 확정하는
   것이 상속채권자의 보호나 청산절차의 신속한 진행을 위하여 필요하다는 점 등을 고려하면, 한정승인에 따른 청산절차가 종료되지 않은
   경우에도 상속재산분할청구가 가능하다(대법원 2014. 7. 25.자 2011스226 결정).
   상속재산의 분할협의는 상속 개시되어 공동상속인 사이에 잠정적 공유가 된 상속재산에 대하여 그 전부 또는 일부를 각 상속인의 단
   독소유로 하거나 새로운 공유관계로 이행시킴으로써 상속재산의 귀속을 확정시키는 것으로 그 성질상 재산권을 목적으로 하는 법률행위이
   므로 사해행위취소권 행사의 대상이 될 수 있다.
   채무자가 자기의 유일한 재산인 부동산을 매각하여 소비하기 쉬운 금전으로 바꾸거나 타인에게 무상으로 이전하여 주는 행위는 특별한
   의 상속분에 관한 권리를 포기함으로써 일반 채권자에 대한 공동담보가 감소한 경우에도 원칙적으로 채권자에 대한 사해행위에 해당한다
   (대법원 2007. 7. 26. 선고 2007다29119 판결).
   공동상속인 중에 피상속인으로부터 재산의 증여 또는 유증 등의 특별수익을 받은 자가 있는 경우에는 이러한 특별수익을 고려하여
   상속인별로 고유의 법정상속분을 수정하여 구체적인 상속분을 산정하게 되는데, 이러한 구체적 상속분을 산정함에 있어서는 상속개시시를
   기준으로 상속재산과 특별수익재산을 평가하여 이를 기초로 하여야 할 것이다.
   Ⅴ. 상속의 포기
   상속인은 상속개시 있음을 안 날로부터 3월 내에 상속의 포기를 할 수 있다. 상속개시 있음을 안 날이라 함은 상속개시의 원인이
   되는 사실의 발생을 알고 이로써 자기가 상속인이 되었음을 안 날을 말한다. 피상속인의 사망으로 상속 개시된 후 상속인이 상속을
   포기하면 상속 개시된 때에 소급하여 그 효력이 생긴다(민법 제1042조).
   상속인은 상속포기를 할 때까지는 그 고유재산에 대하는 것과 동일한 주의로 상속재산을 관리하여야 한다(민법 제1022조).
   상속인이 상속을 포기할 때에는 민법 제1019조 제1항의 기간 내에 가정법원에 포기의 신고를 하여야 한다(민법 제1041조).
   상속포기의 효력은 피상속인의 사망으로 개시된 상속에만 미치고, 그 후 피상속인을 피대습자로 하여 개시된 대습상속에까지 미치지는
   않는다. 대습상속 상속과는 별개의 원인으로 발생하는 것인 데다가 대습상속 개시되기 전에는 이를 포기하는 것이 허용되지 않기
   때문이다. 이는 종전에 상속인의 상속포기로 피대습자의 직계존속이 피대습자를 상속한 경우에도 마찬가지이다.
   상속의 포기자는 처음부터 상속인이 아니었던 것이 된다. 상속포기의 신고가 아직 행하여지지 아니하거나 법원에 의하여 아직 수리되지
   아니하고 있는 동안에 포기자를 제외한 나머지 공동상속인들 사이에 이루어진 상속재산분할협의는 후에 상속포기의 신고가 적법하게
   수리되어 상속포기의 효력이 발생하게 됨으로써 공동상속인의 자격을 가지는 사람들 전원이 행한 것이 되어 소급적으로 유효하게 된다.
   상속의 포기는 1차적으로 피상속인 또는 후순위상속인을 포함하여 다른 상속인 등과의 인격적 관계를 전체적으로 판단하여 행하여지는
   ‘인적 결단’으로서의 성질을 가진다. 그러한 행위에 대하여 비록 상속인인 채무자가 무자력상태에 있다고 하여서 그로 하여금 상속포
   기를 하지 못하게 하는 결과가 될 수 있는 채권자의 사해행위취소를 쉽사리 인정할 것이 아니다.
--
   때에는 민법 제1019조 제1항의 기간 내에 가정법원에 포기의 신고를 하여야 한다.
   Ⅵ. 상속의 한정승인
   부모님이 돌아가시면서 재산은 없고, 대신 빚만 많이 진 상태라면 상속인들은 어떻게 해야 하는가? 법을 몰라서 가만히 있으면 부모
   님 빚을 상속인들이 모두 떠안게 된다. 정말 억울한 일이다. 이런 경우에는 상속재산의 범위에서만 채무를 상속받는 제도가 있다.
   이것이 바로 한정승인제도이다.
   한정승인을 하기 위해서는 원칙적으로 1019조 1항의 기간 내에 법원에 상속재산의 목록을 첨부하여 한정승인의 신고를 하여야 한다
   . 이때 고의로 상속재산을 상속재산의 목록에 기입하지 않으면 단순승인을 한 것으로 보게 된다.
   상속의 한정승인이나 포기는 상속인의 의사표시만으로 효력이 발생하는 것이 아니라 가정법원에 신고를 하여 가정법원의 심판을 받아야
   하며, 심판은 당사자가 이를 고지받음으로써 효력이 발생한다.
   상속인이 한정승인의 신고를 하게 되면 피상속인의 채무에 대한 한정승인자의 책임은 상속재산으로 한정되고, 그 결과 상속채권자는
   특별한 사정이 없는 한 상속인의 고유재산에 대하여 강제집행을 할 수 없으며 상속재산으로부터만 채권의 만족을 받을 수 있다.
   법정단순승인 사유인 민법 제1026조 제3호 소정의 '고의로 재산목록에 기입하지 아니한 때'라는 것은 한정승인을 함에 있어 상속
   재산을 은닉하여 상속채권자를 사해할 의사로써 상속재산을 재산목록에 기입하지 않는 것을 의미한다.
   상속의 한정승인은 채무의 존재를 한정하는 것이 아니라 단순히 그 책임의 범위를 한정하는 것에 불과하다. 상속의 한정승인이
   인정되는 경우에도 상속채무가 존재하는 것으로 인정되는 이상, 법원으로서는 상속재산이 없거나 그 상속재산이 상속채무의 변제에
   부족하다고 하더라도 상속채무 전부에 대한 이행판결을 선고하여야 한다.
   상속채권자가 아닌 한정승인자의 고유채권자가 상속재산에 관하여 저당권 등의 담보권을 취득한 경우, 담보권을 취득한 채권자와 상속채
   권자 사이의 우열관계는 민법상 일반원칙에 따라야 하고 상속채권자가 우선적 지위를 주장할 수 없다.
   상속재산에 관하여 담보권을 취득하였다는 등 사정이 없는 이상, 한정승인자의 고유채권자는 상속채권자가 상속재산으로부터 채권의
   만족을 받지 못한 상태에서 상속재산을 고유채권에 대한 책임재산으로 삼아 이에 대하여 강제집행을 할 수 없다고 보는 것이 형평의
   원칙이나 한정승인제도의 취지에 부합한다.
   상속인은 아직 상속 승인, 포기 등으로 상속관계가 확정되지 않은 동안에도 잠정적으로나마 피상속인의 재산을 당연 취득하고 상속재산
   을 관리할 의무가 있으므로, 상속채권자는 그 기간 동안 상속인을 상대로 상속재산에 관한 가압류결정을 받아 이를 집행할 수 있다.

   그 후 상속인이 상속포기로 인하여 상속인의 지위를 소급하여 상실한다고 하더라도 이미 발생한 가압류의 효력에 영향을 미치지 않는다
   . 따라서 위 상속채권자는 종국적으로 상속인이 된 사람 또는 민법 제1053조에 따라 선임된 상속재산관리인을 채무자로 한 상속재
   산에 대한 경매절차에서 가압류채권자로서 적법하게 배당을 받을 수 있다.
   민법 제1019조 제3항은 민법 제1026조 제2호에 대한 헌법재판소의 헌법불합치 결정 이후에 신설된 조항으로, 위 조항에서
   말하는 상속채무가 상속재산을 초과하는 사실을 중대한 과실로 알지 못한다 함은 ‘상속인이 조금만 주의를 기울였다면 상속채무가
   상속재산을 초과한다는 사실을 알 수 있었음에도 이를 게을리 함으로써 그러한 사실을 알지 못한 것’을 의미한다.

   Ⅶ. 상속의 단순승인
   상속인은 상속개시된 때부터 피상속인의 재산에 관한 포괄적 권리의무를 승계한다(민법 제1005조 본문). 다만 상속인은 상속개시
   있음을 안 날로부터 3월 내에 단순승인이나 한정승인 또는 포기를 할 수 있고(민법 제1019조 제1항 본문), 상속의 포기는
   상속개시된 때에 소급하여 그 효력이 있다(민법 제1042조). 민법 제1026조 제1호는 상속인이 상속재산에 대한 처분행위를 한
   때에는 단순승인을 한 것으로 본다고 규정하고 있다.
   상속인이 가정법원에 상속포기의 신고를 하였더라도 이를 수리하는 가정법원의 심판이 고지되기 이전에 상속재산을 처분하였다면, 이는

    2013다73520 판결).
   피상속인의 사망 후 상속채무가 상속재산을 초과하여 상속인인 배우자와 자녀들이 상속포기를 하였는데, 그 후 피상속인의 직계존속이
   사망하여 민법 제1001조, 제1003조 제2항에 따라 대습상속 개시된 경우에 대습상속인이 민법이 정한 절차와 방식에 따라
   한정승인이나 상속포기를 하지 않으면 단순승인을 한 것으로 간주된다.
   법정단순승인에 관한 민법 제1026조 제3호의 ‘상속재산의 은닉’이라 함은 상속재산의 존재를 쉽게 알 수 없게 만드는 것을
   뜻하고, ‘상속재산의 부정소비’라 함은 정당한 사유 없이 상속재산을 써서 없앰으로써 그 재산적 가치를 상실시키는 것을 의미한다.
   법정단순승인에 관한 민법 제1026조 제3호의 ‘고의로 재산목록에 기입하지 아니한 때’라 함은 한정승인을 함에 있어 상속재산을
   은닉하여 상속채권자를 사해할 의사로써 상속재산을 재산목록에 기입하지 않는 것을 뜻한다(대법원 2010. 4. 29. 선고 200
   9다84936 판결).
   민법 제1026조 제3호는 상속인이 한정승인이나 포기를 한 후에 상속재산을 은닉하거나 부정소비하거나 고의로 재산목록에 기입하지
   않은 때에는 상속인이 단순승인을 한 것으로 본다고 규정하고 있다.
   민법 제1026조 제1호는 상속인이 한정승인 또는 포기를 하기 이전에 상속재산을 처분한 때에만 적용되는 것이고, 상속인이
   경우가 있음은 별론으로 하고, 그것이 같은 조 제3호에 정한 상속재산의 부정소비에 해당되는 경우에만 상속인이 단순승인을 한
   것으로 보아야 한다.
--
   증서의 변조 등을 막고 유언을 확실하게 보존하기 위한 것이다. 유언자는 유언으로 유언집행자를 지정하거나 그 지정을 제3자에게 위
   탁할 수 있다. 유언집행자는 상속인의 대리인으로 본다. 유언이 재산에 관한 것인 때에는 지정 또는 선임에 의한 유언집행자는 지체
   없이 그 재산목록을 작성하여 상속인에게 교부하여야 한다.
   Ⅸ. 유류분과 유류분반환청구권
   유류분이라는 용어를 들어본 적이 있을 것이다. 매우 어려운 용어다. 유류분(遺留分)이라 함은 상속재산 중 상속인에게 유보되는 최
   소한의 몫을 말한다.
   수도 있고, 상속인이 여러 사람인 경우 그 중 일부에게 법정상속분을 초과하여 유증할 수도 있다.
   유류분제도는 피상속인의 재산처분행위로부터 유족의 생존권을 보호하고 법정상속분의 일정 비율에 해당하는 부분을 유류분으로 산정하여
   상속인의 상속재산 형성에 대한 기여와 상속재산에 대한 기대를 보장하는 데 그 목적이 있다.
   상속 개시된 후에는 유류분권은 포기할 수 있다. 그러나 상속 개시되기 전에는 유류분권도 포기할 수 없다. 상속인 가운데 피상
   속인의 배우자, 직계비속, 직계존속, 형제자매는 유류분권자이다. 피상속인의 4촌 이내의 방계혈족이 상속인인 때에는 유류분이 인정
   되지 않는다. 상속결격자나 상속을 포기한 자는 유류분권리자가 될 수 없다.
   직계비속과 배우자의 유류분은 그 법정상속분의 1/2이다. 직계존속과 형제자매의 유류분은 그 법정상속분의 1/3이다. 유류분은 피
   상속인의 상속개시 시에 가진 재산의 총액에 증여의 가액을 가산하고, 채무의 전액을 공제하여 이를 산정한다.
   민법 제1118조에 따라 준용되는 민법 제1008조는 공동상속인 중에 피상속인으로부터 재산의 증여 또는 유증을 받은 특별수익자가
    있는 경우에 공동상속인 사이의 공평을 도모하기 위하여 수증재산을 상속분의 선급으로 다루어 구체적인 상속분을 산정하는 데 참작하
   도록 하려는 데 그 취지가 있다.
   유류분제도가 피상속인이 생전에 자유롭게 처분하는 것을 원천적으로 막는 것은 아니다. 또한 공동상속인이 피상속인으로부터 받은 증여
   가 모두 유류분반환의 대상인 특별수익이 되는 것은 아니고, 어떠한 생전 증여가 특별수익에 해당하는지는 피상속인의 생전의 자산,
   수입, 생활수준, 가정상황 등을 참작하고 공동상속인 사이의 형평을 고려하여 생전 증여가 장차 상속인으로 될 사람에게 돌아갈 상속
   재산 가운데 그의 몫 일부를 미리 주는 것이라고 볼 수 있는지에 따라 판단된다. 유류분의 범위도 법정상속분의 일부로 제한되어 있
   다.
--
   없는 한 법원은 유류분권리자가 청구하는 방법에 따라 원물반환을 명하여야 한다.
   유류분반환의 범위는 상속개시 당시 피상속인의 순재산과 문제 된 증여재산을 합한 재산을 평가하여 그 재산액에 유류분청구권자의 유류
   분비율을 곱하여 얻은 유류분액을 기준으로 산정하는데, 증여받은 재산의 시가는 상속개시 당시를 기준으로 산정해야 한다.
   어느 공동상속인 1인이 특별수익으로서 여러 부동산을 증여받아 그 증여재산으로 유류분권리자에게 유류분 부족액을 반환하는 경우
   반환해야 할 증여재산의 범위는 특별한 사정이 없는 한 민법 제1115조 제2항을 유추적용하여 증여재산의 가액에 비례하여 안분하는
   방법으로 정함이 타당하다.
   다만 증여 이후 수증자나 수증자로부터 증여재산을 양수받은 사람이 자기의 비용으로 증여재산의 성상 등을 변경하여 상속개시 당시 그
    가액이 증가되어 있는 경우, 유류분 부족액을 산정할 때 기준이 되는 증여재산의 가액에 관해서는 위와 같이 변경된 성상 등을 기
   준으로 증여재산의 상속개시 당시 가액을 산정하면 유류분권리자에게 부당한 이익을 주게 되므로, 그와 같은 변경이 있기 전 증여 당
   시의 성상 등을 기준으로 상속개시 당시 가액을 산정해야 한다.
   유류분 부족액 확정 후 증여재산별로 반환 지분을 산정할 때 기준이 되는 증여재산의 총가액에 관해서는 상속개시 당시의 성상 등을
   기준으로 상속개시 당시의 가액을 산정함이 타당하다.
   유류분을 포함한 상속의 포기는 상속 개시된 후 일정한 기간 내에만 가능하고 가정법원에 신고하는 등 일정한 절차와 방식을 따라야
   만 그 효력이 있으므로, 상속개시 전에 한 상속포기약정은 그와 같은 절차와 방식에 따르지 아니한 것으로 효력이 없다(대법원 19
   98. 7. 24. 선고 98다9021 판결)
   상속인 중의 1인이 피상속인의 생존시에 피상속인에 대하여 상속을 포기하기로 약정하였다고 하더라도, 상속개시 후 민법이 정하는 절
   차와 방식에 따라 상속포기를 하지 아니한 이상, 상속개시 후에 자신의 상속권을 주장하는 것은 정당한 권리행사로서 권리남용에 해당
   하거나 또는 신의칙에 반하는 권리의 행사라고 할 수 없다(대법원 1998. 7. 24. 선고 98다9021 판결).
   유류분권리자의 유류분 부족액은 유류분액에서 특별수익액과 순상속분액을 공제하는 방법으로 산정하는데, 피상속인이 상속개시 시에 채무
   를 부담하고 있던 경우 유류분액은 민법 제1113조 제1항에 따라 피상속인이 상속개시 시에 가진 재산의 가액에 증여재산의 가액을
    가산하고 채무의 전액을 공제하여 유류분 산정의 기초가 되는 재산액을 확정한 다음, 거기에 민법 제1112조에서 정한 유류분 비
   율을 곱하여 산정한다. 그리고 유류분액에서 공제할 순상속분액은 특별수익을 고려한 구체적인 상속분에서 유류분권리자가 부담하는 상속
   채무를 공제하여 산정하고, 이때 유류분권리자의 구체적인 상속분보다 유류분권리자가 부담하는 상속채무가 더 많다면 그 초과분을 유류
   분액에 가산하여 유류분 부족액을 산정하여야 한다(대법원 2022. 1. 27. 선고 2017다265884 판결).

   Ⅹ. 상속회복청구권
   상속회복청구권은 진정한 상속인이 아니면서도 상속인인 것처럼 주장하고 행동하는 자(참칭상속인)에 대하여, 진정한 상속인이 상속재산
   의 반환을 구할 수 있는 권리를 말한다. 참칭상속인이라 함은 정당한 상속권이 없음에도 재산상속인임을 신뢰케 하는 외관을 갖추거나
    상속인이라고 참칭하면서 상속재산의 전부 또는 일부를 점유함으로써 진정한 상속인의 재산상속권을 침해하는 자를 가리킨다.
   공동상속인의 한 사람이 다른 상속인의 상속권을 부정하고 자기만이 상속권이 있다고 참칭하는 경우도 여기에 해당한다. 이와 같은
   상속회복청구의 상대방이 될 수 있다(대법원 1991. 2. 22. 선고 90다카19470 판결).
   공동상속인의 한 사람이 다른 상속인의 상속권을 부정하고 자기만이 상속권이 있다고 참칭하여 상속재산인 부동산에 관하여 단독 명의로
    소유권이전등기를 한 경우는 물론이고, 상속을 유효하게 포기한 공동상속인 중 한 사람이 그 사실을 숨기고 여전히 공동상속인의 지
   위에 남아 있는 것처럼 참칭하여 상속지분에 따른 소유권이전등기를 한 경우에도 참칭상속인에 해당할 수 있다.
   공동상속인 중 1인이 협의분할에 의한 상속을 원인으로 하여 상속부동산에 관한 소유권이전등기를 마친 경우에, 협의분할이 다른
   공동상속인의 동의 없이 이루어진 것이어서 무효라는 이유로 다른 공동상속인이 위 등기의 말소를 청구하는 소는 상속회복청구의 소에
   해당한다.
   상속회복청구권의 행사는 소의 제기에 의하여 할 수 있다. 민법이 규정하는 상속회복의 소는 재산상속권이 참칭재산상속인으로 인하여
   침해된 때에 진정한 상속권자가 그 회복을 청구하는 소를 가리킨다.
   상속회복청구의 소가 이유 있는 것으로 인용되면, 상대방은 상속인에게 그가 점유하는 상속재산을 반환하여야 한다. 수인의 상속인이
   부동산을 공동으로 상속하는 경우 그와 같이 공동상속을 받은 사람 중 한 사람이 공유물의 보존행위로서 공동상속인 모두를 위하여 상
   속등기를 신청하는 것도 가능하다.
   상속회복청구권이 제척기간의 경과로 소멸하게 되면 상속인은 상속인으로서의 지위 즉 상속에 따라 승계한 개개의 권리의무 또한 총괄적
   으로 상실하게 된다. 그 반사적 효과로서 참칭상속인의 지위는 확정되어 참칭상속인이 상속개시의 시로부터 소급하여 상속인으로서의 지
   위를 취득한 것으로 봄이 상당하므로, 상속재산은 상속 개시일로 소급하여 참칭상속인의 소유로 된다.
   재산상속에 관하여 진정한 상속인임을 전제로 그 상속으로 인한 소유권 또는 지분권 등 재산권의 귀속을 주장하고, 참칭상속인 또는
   자기들만이 재산상속을 하였다는 일부 공동상속인들을 상대로 상속재산인 부동산에 관한 등기의 말소 등을 청구하는 경우에도, 그
   소유권 또는 지분권이 귀속되었다는 주장이 상속을 원인으로 하는 것인 이상 그 청구원인 여하에 불구하고 이는 민법 제999조
   소정의 상속회복청구의 소라고 해석함이 상당하다(대법원 1991. 12. 24. 선고 90다5740 전원합의체 판결).
   민법 제982조 제2항의 상속회복청구권의 소멸에 관한 규정은 상속에 관한 법률관계의 확정을 조속히 매듭짓기 위하여 단기제척기간을
    설정한 것이므로 상속개시일로부터 10년을 경과한 후에 상속권의 침해가 있었다고 하더라도 10년의 제척기간 경과로 인하여 상속회
   복청구권은 소멸한다고 보아야 한다(대법원 1994. 10. 21. 선고 94다18249 판결).
   상속회복청구권의 제척기간 기산점이 되는 민법 제999조 제2항 소정의 ‘상속권의 침해를 안 날’이라 함은 자기가 진정한
   상속인임을 알고 또 자기가 상속에서 제외된 사실을 안 때를 가리키는 것으로서, 단순히 상속권 침해의 추정이나 의문만으로는
   충분하지 않다.
   제척기간의 기산점이 되는 ‘상속권의 침해행위가 있은 날’이라 함은 참칭상속인이 상속재산의 전부 또는 일부를 점유하거나 상속재산인
   부동산에 관하여 소유권이전등기를 마치는 등의 방법에 의하여 진정한 상속인의 상속권을 침해하는 행위를 한 날을 의미한다.
   인지심판 확정으로 피상속인의 사망시에 소급하여 상속재산을 공동상속하였음을 원인으로 하여 그 상속분에 따른 지분권을 취득하였음을
   전제로 그 지분권에 기하여 공동상속인들에 대하여 상속재산을 처분한 대금의 반환청구를 하는 소는 상속회복청구의 소에 해당한다.
   상속회복청구의 소로 인정되는 이상 그것이 개개의 재산에 대한 구체적인 권리를 행사하는 경우와 일반적인 상속인의 지위회복이나
   상속재산 전체에 관한 상속인간의 분할을 의미하는 일반 상속회복청구의 경우를 나누어 제척기간의 기산점을 달리 볼 수는 없다.
   Ⅺ. 상속세
   상속세율은 상속재산이 과세표준 30억 원을 넘을 경우 최대 50%에 이른다. 삼성그룹의 이건희 회장의 경우 상속세는 무려
   12조원에 달했다고 한다. 부모로부터 재산을 물려받는 방법은 상속과 증여가 있다. 재산이 적은 경우에는 별 문제가 없지만,
   재산이 몇십억 원만 넘어도 상속 어려운 문제가 된다. 특히 상속인이 여러 사람인 경우, 이해관계를 조정하는 것이 쉽지 않다.
   재산이 많은 경우, 상속인이 수인인 경우에는 미리 생전에 장기간에 걸쳐 구체적인 상속 설계와 자산관리를 할 필요가 있다.
   상속세는 재산상속을 통한 부의 세습과 집중의 완화 등을 위하여 마련된 것이다. 상속세는 상속으로 인한 상속개시일 현재의
   상속재산에 대하여 부과하는 것으로 상속세를 납부할 의무 역시 상속 개시되는 때 성립한다. 상속인은 각자가 받았거나 받을 재산을
--
   2016두54275 판결).
   상속인은 상속재산 중 각자가 받았거나 받을 재산의 비율에 따라 상속세를 납부할 의무가 있다. 이는 피상속인의 사망을 계기로
   무상으로 이전되는 재산을 취득한 자에게 실질적 담세력을 고려하여 취득분에 따른 과세를 하기 위한 것이므로, 상속세의 납부세액을
   결정할 때 이를 반영하여야 한다(대법원 2018. 12. 13. 선고 2016두54275 판결).
   상속세법 제7조의2 제1항의 규정은 피상속인이 상속개시일 전 2년 이내에 상속재산을 처분하는 경우 그 처분대금이 현금으로 상속인
   에게 상속 또는 증여되어 상속세가 부당하게 경감될 우려가 많으므로 이를 방지하기 위하여 그 중 용도가 객관적으로 명백하지 아니한
    금액에 대하여는 일정한 요건하에 상속인이 이를 현금상속한 것으로 인정하여 상속세 과세가액에 포함시킨 것이다(대법원 1997.
   9. 9. 선고 97누2764 판결).

   갑자기 돌아가시면 자녀들은 우왕좌왕하게 된다. 부모 재산이 없으면 별문제가 없지만, 집이라도 있고, 그 외 다른 재산이 있으면,
    상속문제가 간단하지 않다. 자녀들 사이에 상속재산 때문에 분쟁이 생기고, 상속세가 적지 않기 때문에 상속세를 납부하는 것도 간
   단하지 않다.

[예규‧판례] 서울고법, 일시적 2주택자 종부세 합당…상속, 불가피한 요인 아니야

6월 1일 이전에 팔았다면 납세자 아닌 양도자가 납부
상속만으로 불가피한 외부요인, 지나친 넓은 해석 안 돼

--

   (조세금융신문=고승주 기자) 상속으로 다주택자가 된 납세자가 종합부동산세(종부세)를 취소해달라고 소송을 냈지만, 2심에서도
   패소했다.
--

   2심에서는 상속란 불가항력적 요인으로 보유한 주택에 과세하는 건 부당하다는 논리를 폈으나 패소했다.

--

   서울 서초구 아파트 소유자 A씨는 2019년 8월 강남구 아파트 지분 4분의 1을 상속받은 후 2020년 6월 27일 팔았다.

--

   A씨는 2심에서는 전략을 바꾸어 불가피한 외부 요인이 있을 경우 법을 기계적으로 적용할 수 없다는 논리를 꺼냈다. 상속
   불가피한 외부요인이니 상속으로 인한 일시적 2주택은 종부세를 물릴 수 없다는 이유다.


   2심은 상속을 받은 지 처분할 수 있는 수개월의 시간적 여유도 있었고, 상속 시점에서 부동산 말고 다른 재산을 상속받는 것도
   가능했다며 불가피한 외부 요인이 있다고 보지 않았다.

   인생에서 절대 피할 수 없는 두 가지가 죽음과 세금이라는 유명한 말처럼, 누구에게나 죽음은 찾아오고 상속 문제가 발생하기
   시작합니다. 미국이나 유럽과는 달리 아직 우리나라는 미리부터 상속 문제를 대비하지 않는 경향이 짙고, 특히 열 손가락 깨물어 안
   아픈 손가락이 없다지만, 자식 사이에 다소 불공평하게 재산을 분배하는 모습도 자주 보입니다. 이 경우 부모님들께서는 나름
--

   한편, 많은 상속 관련 법률상담을 통해 느낀 바로는 많은 분들이 유류분 제도가 있다는 사실 자체는 잘 알고 있지만,
   유류분반환청구의 기본적인 요건을 제대로 알지 못하거나 자신에게 애초부터 청구할 유류분이 없다는 사실을 알지 못하는 경우도
--

   우선 상속 피상속인이 사망하여야 비로소 개시되는 것이므로 만약 부모님이 살아 계시는 상황이라면 상속을 받을 수도 없고, 유류분
   청구도 불가능합니다. 당연하다고 생각하는 분도 계시겠지만, 이와 같은 질문이 생각보다 많이 들어오고 특히 아직 증여되지 않은
--

   그런데, 유류분이란 상속인들의 각 상속분을 일정부분 확보하여 유족들의 생계를 유지할 수 있도록 하는 제도에 불과하고, 부모님이
   살아계실 때 부모님 명의의 재산을 처분하는 것에 관여할 수는 없습니다. 즉, 자식이라고 하더라도 살아생전 부모님이 재산을
--

   다음으로 유류분은 피상속인이 생전에 다른 상속인들에게 생전증여하였거나 유언을 통해 증여한 관계로 그 증여나 유언이 없었더라면
   받을 수 있었던 몫의 일정 비율을 민법이 확보하여 주는데, 상속인이 직계비속(자녀 등)이나 배우자라면 1/2, 직계존속(부모
   등)이나 형제·자매라면 1/3을 보장해주고 있습니다. 만약 A에게 자식 a와 b가 있고, A가 살아생전 자신의 유일한 재산인
--

   그런데 부모님께서 살아생전 일부 형제·자매에게 보다 많은 증여를 하기는 하였으나, 막상 계산을 해보니 자신도 증여나 상속을 통해
--

   마지막으로 유류분반환청구는 일정한 기한 내에 행사하지 않으면 소멸되는 권리로서, 유류분권리자가 상속의 개시와 반환하여야 할 증여
   또는 유증을 한 사실을 안 때로부터 1년 내에 하지 않거나 상속 개시한 때로부터 10년을 경과한 경우 유류분반환청구를 할 수
   없게됩니다(민법 제1117조). 요즘 남들에게 말하지 못하는 기구한 사연이 있는 가정이 많지만, 보통은 피상속인이 언제 사망을
   하였는지, 증여 등 사실이 있었는지 등은 알고 계시므로 신속히 청구에 나아가야 합니다.
--
   만약 소식이 닿지 않은 관계로 사망 사실 등을 뒤늦게 알게 된 사정이 있더라도 10년이 지나지 않았다면 알게 된 때를 기준으로
   1년 이내에 신속히 청구를 하여야 합니다. 대부분의 경우 오래전 상속 당시 억울한 마음을 10년이고 20년이고 가지고 계셨다가
   뒤늦게 변호사와 상담을 하는 경우가 많은데 안타깝지만 너무 늦으셨다고 말씀드릴 수밖에 없습니다.</text>

    취득세 계산 및 방법
   상속인이 부동산, 차량, 골프회원권, 콘도미니엄회원권 등을 상속받은 경우에는 취득세를 부담합니다.
   여기에서는 상속을 통해 부과되는 취득세의 대강을 기술한 것이므로 세액의 산출에 관한 자세한 사항은 지방자치단체에 문의하시기
   바랍니다.

   취득세의 세율
   부동산 등을 상속하게 되면 그 부동산에 대한 취득세는 위에 따른 과세표준에 다음의 구분에 따른 표준세율을 적용하여 계산한 금액을

   A. 상속재산에 부동산이 있다면 상속의 한정승인 시 상속을 원인으로 등기를 하기 때문에 부동산의 취득세를 부담합니다. 이는
   취득세가 재화의 이전이라는 사실 자체를 포착하여 거기에 담세력을 인정하고 부과하는 유통세의 일종으로 부동산의 취득자가 그</text>

   제목 피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우 배우자와 손자녀 또는 직계존속이 공동상속인이 되는지, 배우자가
   단독상속인이 되는지 여부[대법원 2023. 3. 23. 선고 전원합의체 결정]
   작성자 법원도서관 작성일 2023-03-23
--

   [피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우 배우자와 손자녀 또는 직계존속이 공동상속인이 되는지, 배우자가
   단독상속인이 되는지 여부]

   ◇피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우의 상속인(= 배우자 단독상속)◇

     1. 상속에 관한 입법례와 민법의 입법 연혁
     우리 민법은 제정 당시부터 배우자 상속을 혈족 상속과 구분되는 특별한 상속으로 규정하지 않았다. 상속에 관한 구 관습도
   배우자가 일정한 경우에 단독상속인이 되었을 뿐 배우자 상속과 혈족 상속을 특별히 구분하지 않았다. 위와 같은 입법 연혁에 비추어
   보면, 구 관습이 적용될 때는 물론이고 제정 민법 이후 현재에 이르기까지 배우자는 상속인 중 한 사람이고 다른 혈족 상속인과
   법률상 지위에서 차이가 없다.
     2. 민법의 문언 및 체계적․논리적 해석
     민법 제1000조부터 제1043조까지 각각의 조문에서 규정하는 ‘상속인’은 모두 동일한 의미임이 명백하다. 따라서 민법
   제1043조의 ‘상속인이 수인인 경우’ 역시 민법 제1000조 제2항의 ‘상속인이 수인인 때’와 동일한 의미로서 같은 항의
   ‘공동상속인이 되는’ 경우에 해당하므로 그 공동상속인에 배우자도 당연히 포함되며, 민법 제1043조에 따라 상속포기자의 상속분이
   귀속되는 ‘다른 상속인’에도 배우자가 포함된다.
     이에 따라 공동상속인인 배우자와 여러 명의 자녀들 중 일부 또는 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우의 법률효과를 본다. 공동상속인인
   배우자와 자녀들 중 자녀 일부만 상속을 포기한 경우에는 민법 제1043조에 따라 그 상속포기자인 자녀의 상속분이 배우자와 상속을
   포기하지 않은 다른 자녀에게 귀속된다. 이와 동일하게 공동상속인인 배우자와 자녀들 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우 민법
   제1043조에 따라 상속을 포기한 자녀의 상속분은 남아 있는 ‘다른 상속인’인 배우자에게 귀속되고, 따라서 배우자가 단독상속인이
   된다.
     이에 비하여 피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 모두 상속을 포기한 경우 민법 제1043조는 적용되지 않는다.
     3. 상속재산 중 소극재산이 적극재산보다 많을 경우 상속포기자의 의사
     피상속인의 배우자와 자녀들 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기하였다는 이유로 피상속인의 배우자와 손자녀 또는 직계존속이 공동상속인이
   된다고 보는 것은 위와 같은 당사자들의 기대나 의사에 반하고 사회 일반의 법감정에도 반한다. 일반인의 입장에서 피상속인의
   배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기하면 피상속인의 배우자와 손자녀 또는 직계존속이 공동상속인이 되리라는 점을 예상하기도
   어렵다.
     4. 실무상 문제
     종래 판례에 따라 피상속인의 배우자와 손자녀 또는 직계존속이 공동상속인이 되었더라도 그 이후 피상속인의 손자녀 또는
   직계존속이 다시 적법하게 상속을 포기함에 따라 결과적으로는 피상속인의 배우자가 단독상속인이 되는 실무례가 많이 발견된다. 결국
   공동상속인들의 의사에 따라 배우자가 단독상속인으로 남게 되는 동일한 결과가 되지만, 피상속인의 손자녀 또는 직계존속에게 별도로
   상속포기 재판 절차를 거치도록 하고 그 과정에서 상속채권자와 상속인들 모두에게 불필요한 분쟁을 증가시키며 무용한 절차에 시간과
--
     5. 판례 변경의 타당성
     이상에서 살펴본 바와 같이 상속에 관한 입법례와 민법의 입법 연혁, 민법 조문의 문언 및 체계적ㆍ논리적 해석, 채무상속에서
   상속포기자의 의사, 실무상 문제 등을 종합하여 보면, 피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우에는 배우자가
   단독상속인이 된다고 봄이 타당하다.

   ☞  망인 사망 후 망인의 아내는 상속한정승인을 하고 4명의 자녀들은 모두 상속포기를 하였는데, 망인에 대하여 확정판결을 받은
   피신청인이 망인의 손자녀인 신청인들과 망인의 아내에게 위 판결에 기한 채무가 공동상속되었다는 이유로 이 사건 승계집행문
   부여신청을 하여 승계집행문을 부여받았고, 이에 대해 신청인들이 자신들은 망인의 상속인이 아니라고 주장하며 승계집행문 부여에 대한
   이의를 신청한 사안임

   ☞  원심은, 종래 판례(대법원 2015. 5. 14. 선고 2013다48852 판결)에 따라 피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀
   전부가 상속을 포기한 경우 피상속인에게 손자녀가 있으면 배우자가 그 손자녀가 공동으로 상속인이 된다는 이유로 신청인들의
   이의신청을 기각하였음

   ☞  대법원은 전원합의체 판결을 통하여, 상속에 관한 입법례와 민법의 입법 연혁, 민법 조문의 문언 및 체계적ㆍ논리적 해석,
   채무상속에서 상속포기자의 의사, 실무상 문제 등을 종합하여 보면, 피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한
   경우에는 배우자가 단독상속인이 된다고 봄이 타당하다고 판단하여, 종래 판례를 변경하고 종래 판례에 따른 원심을 파기·환송함

--
   ☞  반대의견의 요지는 다음과 같음
     - 우리 민법에 따르면 피상속인의 배우자는 피상속인에게 직계비속이 있는 경우 직계비속과 공동상속인이 되고(제1000조,
   제1003조), 직계비속인 손자녀가 있는 경우 자녀 모두가 상속을 포기하더라도 상속포기의 소급효에 따라 자녀는 처음부터 상속인이
   아니었던 것이 되어 피상속인의 배우자는 손자녀와 공동상속인이 됨(제1042조)
     - 따라서 상속포기자의 상속분 귀속에 관한 민법 제1043조는 상속인 결정 및 상속포기의 소급효를 전제로 한 것이므로 위와
   같은 법리에 어긋나지 않도록 해석하여야 함. 즉 민법 제1043조에 따라 상속포기자의 상속분이 귀속되는 상속인은 민법
   제1000조, 제1003조 등에 따라 정해지는 상속인을 의미하고, 상속포기자의 상속분은 위와 같이 종국적으로 정해진 상속인의
   상속분이 민법 제1009조에서 정한 법정상속분의 비율로 산정되도록 해당 상속인에게 귀속되어야 한다고 해석하여야 함
     - 상속을 포기한 상속인의 진정한 의도와 목적이 무엇인지는 외부에서 쉽게 알 수 없으므로, 상속포기의 효력은 법률에 규정된
   대로만 인정하여야 하고, 상속인의 의사와 목적을 고려하여 상속포기의 효력을 정할 수는 없으며, 상속순위와 상속인 결정의 원칙도
   당사자의 의사로 변경할 수 없음
     - 우리 민법은 여러 제도를 통해 상속채무를 승계하는 상속인을 충분히 보호할 수 있으므로, 상속채무를 승계하는 상속인의 보호
   문제는 종래 판례를 변경할 이유가 되지 못함
     - 종래 판례가 선고된 후 그 판결에 따라 공동상속 이루어진다는 전제에서 오랫동안 법률관계가 형성되어 왔음. 종래 판례를
   변경하는 것은 이와 같이 형성된 법률관계의 안정에 심각한 혼란을 초래할 수 있음</text>

   상속인과 상속순위?
   상속인이란 상속 개시되어 피상속인의 재산상의 지위를 법률에 따라 승계하는 사람을 말합니다.
   상속 1순위로 피상속인의 직계비속ㆍ배우자, 2순위로 피상속인의 직계존속ㆍ배우자, 3순위로 피상속인의 형제자매, 4순위로
   피상속인의 4촌 이내의 방계혈족의 순서로 이루어집니다.
    상속인(相續人)이란?
    상속인의 개념
    “상속인”이란 상속 개시되어 피상속인의 재산상의 지위를 법률에 따라 승계하는 사람을 말합니다.
   ※ “피상속인(被相續人)”이란 사망 또는 실종선고로 인하여 상속재산을 물려주는 사람을 말합니다.

    상속인은 사람이어야 하며, 법인은 상속을 받을 수 없고 유증만 받을 수 있습니다.
    상속인은 상속개시 시점에 살아있어야 합니다.
    다만, 태아는 상속순위에 대해 이미 출생한 것으로 봅니다(「민법」 제1000조제3항).
   √ 즉, 태아가 상속개시 시점에는 출생하지 않았더라도 상속 후 출생하면 상속개시 당시에 상속인인 것으로 봅니다(대법원 1976.
   9. 14. 선고 76다1365 판결).
--

    다음과 같은 사람도 상속인이 될 수 있습니다. 
   1. 태아(胎兒)
--
   6. 양자를 보낸 친생부모(親生父母)
   7. 북한에 있는 상속인
   8. 외국국적을 가지고 있는 상속인
    다음과 같은 사람은 상속인이 될 수 없습니다. 
   1. 적모서자(嫡母庶子)
   2. 사실혼(事實婚)의 배우자
   3. 상속결격 사유가 있는 사람
   4. 유효하지 않은 양자
--
   6. 이혼한 배우자
    상속순위
    상속순위
    상속인은 다음과 같은 순위로 정해지고, 피상속인의 법률상 배우자는 피상속인의 직계비속 또는 피상속인의 직계존속인 상속인이 있는
   경우에는 이들과 함께 공동상속인이 되며, 피상속인의 직계비속 또는 피상속인의 직계존속인 상속인이 없는 때에는 단독으로 상속인이
   됩니다(「민법」 제1000조제1항 및 제1003조제1항).
--
   1.
   피상속인의 직계비속
   (자녀, 손자녀 등)
   항상 상속인이 됨
   2.
   피상속인의 직계존속
   (부·모, 조부모 등)
   직계비속이 없는 경우 상속인이 됨
   3.
   피상속인의 형제자매
   1, 2 순위가 없는 경우 상속인이 됨
   4.
   피상속인의 4촌 이내의 방계혈족
   (삼촌, 고모, 이모 등)
   1, 2, 3 순위가 없는 경우 상속인이 됨
   ※ 판례는 피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우 배우자와 피상속인의 손자녀 또는 직계존속이 공동으로
   상속인이 되는지 배우자가 단독상속하는지 여부가 문제된 사안에서, "상속을 포기한 자는 상속개시된 때부터 상속인이 아니었던 것과
   같은 지위에 놓이게 되므로, 피상속인의 배우자와 자녀 중 자녀 전부가 상속을 포기한 경우에는 배우자와 피상속인의 손자녀 또는

    법률상 혼인을 맺은 사람을 말합니다.
     따라서 사실혼 관계에 있는 배우자는 상속을 받을 수 없습니다.

   사례)
    다음의 경우에 누가 상속인이 될까요? 
   Q. A(남)는 가족으로 부모님(B·C), 법률상 혼인관계인 부인(D) 그리고 유효하게 입양한 자녀(E)가 있습니다. A가
   사망한 경우 누가 상속인이 될까요?
   A. A의 부모님(B·C)은 모두 1촌의 직계존속입니다. 부인(D)은 법률상 배우자이고, 입양한 자녀(E)는 1촌의
   직계비속입니다. 이 경우 A가 사망하면, 직계비속인 입양한 자녀(E)는 1순위의 상속인이 됩니다. 한편, 법률상 배우자(D)도
   직계비속과 함께 1순위의 상속인이 되므로, D와 E는 공동상속인이 됩니다(「민법」 제1000조 및 「민법」 제1003조).
   한편, A의 부모님(B·C)는 후순위 상속인이 되어 상속받지 못합니다.
   사례)
    피상속인이 외국인인 경우에도 우리나라 법에 의해 상속받을 수 있나요? 
   A. 상속 사망 당시 피상속인의 본국법(本國法)에 따릅니다(「국제사법」 제49조). 따라서 피상속인이 외국인인 경우에는 그
   외국인의 국적에 따른 상속법이 적용됩니다. 예를 들어 사망한 사람이 베트남 국적을 가지고 있는 경우, 상속인은 한국국적을 가진
   한국인이라고 할지라도 상속인, 상속순위, 상속분 등의 모든 상속관계가 베트남의 상속법에 따라 결정됩니다.
   배우자상속인
    배우자상속인이란?
    “배우자상속인”이란 상속인인 배우자를 말하며, 이때의 배우자는 법률상 혼인관계에 있는 사람일 것을 요합니다.
    따라서 사실혼 관계의 배우자는 상속인이 될 수 없습니다. 다만, 특별한 연고가 있는 경우 상속인이 없을 때에 한하여 상속재산을
   분여(分與)받을 수 있을 뿐입니다(「민법」 제1057조의2).
    배우자는 1순위인 직계비속과 같은 순위로 공동상속인이 되며, 직계비속이 없는 경우에는 2순위인 직계존속과 공동상속인이 됩니다.
   한편, 직계비속과 직계존속이 모두 없는 경우에는 배우자가 단독상속인이 됩니다(「민법」 제1003조).
    배우자의 공동상속
    배우자가 직계비속 또는 직계존속과 공동으로 상속한 경우에는 이들은 모두 공동상속인이 됩니다.
    따라서 배우자와 직계비속 또는 직계존속은 각자의 상속분만큼 상속재산을 공유하게 됩니다.
   사례)
    사실혼 배우자도 상속을 받을 수 있나요? 
   Q. A(남)는 B(녀)와 결혼식을 치르고 신혼여행을 다녀왔으나 아직 혼인신고는 하지 않은 상태에서 사망하였습니다. B(녀)는
   A의 상속인이 될 수 있을까요?
   A. A와 B는 혼인의 의사로 A와 결혼생활을 시작하였지만, A의 사망 당시 혼인신고가 이루어지지 않았기 때문에 B는 A의
   사실혼 배우자에 불과합니다. 배우자는 1순위로 상속인이 되는 것이 원칙이나 이는 혼인신고까지 마친 법률상 배우자를 말하며,
   사실혼 배우자는 포함하지 않습니다. 다만, A와 B가 사실혼 관계임이 입증되는 경우, B는 각종 유족연금의 수혜자가 될 수
   있으며, A와 B가 거주하는 주택의 임대차 관계에서도 임차인이 상속인 없이 사망한 경우에는 그 주택에서 가정공동생활을 하던
   사실상의 혼인 관계에 있는 사람이 임차인의 권리와 의무를 승계합니다(「주택임대차보호법」 제9조제1항). 또한 A의 상속인이 없는
   경우에는 A의 상속재산에 대해 특별연고자로서 그 분여를 청구할 수 있는 권리를 가집니다(「민법」 제1057조의2).
    대습상속인
    대습상속인이란
    “대습상속인”이란 ‘상속인이 될 직계비속 또는 형제자매(피대습인)’가 상속개시 전에 사망하거나 결격자가 된 경우에 사망하거나
   결격된 사람의 순위에 갈음하여 상속인이 되는 ‘피대습인의 직계비속 또는 배우자’를 말합니다(「민법」 제1001조 및
   제1003조제2항).
    대습상속인이 되려면
    - 대습원인이 있어야 합니다.
    “(사망하지 않았거나 상속결격이 없었더라면) 상속인이 될 직계비속 또는 형제자매”가 “상속개시 전”에 “사망하거나 결격자”가
   되어야 합니다.
    - 대습자로서의 요건을 갖추어야 합니다.
    “(사망하지 않았거나 상속결격이 없었더라면) 상속인이 될 사람”의 “직계비속 또는 배우자”이어야 합니다.
   사례)
    아버지를 여읜 아들은 할아버지의 재산을 상속받을 수 있나요? 
   Q. A의 부모님은 A가 어릴 때 이혼하였으며 A의 아버지는 1년 전 사망하였습니다. A의 할아버지는 A의 아버지 X 이외에도
   자녀(A의 고모 Y)를 한 명 더 두고 있고, 할머니(Z)도 생존해 계십니다. 이 경우 A는 할아버지의 재산을 상속받을 수
   있나요?
   A. 상속인이 될 직계비속이 상속개시 전에 사망한 경우에는 그의 직계비속이 대습상속인이 됩니다(「민법」 제1001조). 이때
   아버지는 상속인이 될 직계비속이고, 할아버지의 사망 전에 사망하였으므로 그의 직계비속인 A가 대습상속인이 되어 상속을 받을 수
   있습니다.
