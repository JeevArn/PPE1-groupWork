The development and management of territorial heritage: The recent experience
of Argentina

Título del libro: Territorial heritage and spatial planning: A geographical
perspective

   «Identity, culture, heritage and territory are convergent concepts in
   the sense that their essential constitutive attributes make up the
--
   of an interested transfer or an ever-renewing creation» (Bustos Cara,
   2004: 17). As Guy Di Meo said, heritage values are defined like the
   territory, as «time which makes sense and has meaning as if it were
--
   cultural references that generate ideological and political control».
   «How can we understand territory without assigning a heritage value to
   it?». «Neither territory nor heritage represent an a priori fact. Yet
   every object may have a heritage function and every space may be
   transformed into a territory, if one or the other is integrated in a
   communicational context» (Di Meo, 1998: 59). The idea of heritage
   covers a broad and extremely dynamic conceptual field, and this is why
--
   can moderate between conflicts and may keep its dynamic character in
   check. In this sense, there is a close relation between heritage and
   territory and between heritage and development, and this relation is
   always variable in content, depending on the ideological, political,
--
   is a dominantly liberal or neoliberal vision within the globalisation
   framework, then the processes that lead to heritage status and its
   institutionalisation have acquired different characteristics and

What is Cultural Heritage?

--
   inches (Musée du Louvre)
   We often hear about the importance of cultural heritage. But what is
   cultural heritage? And whose heritage is it? Whose national heritage,
   for example, does the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci belong to? Is it
   French or Italian?
   First of all, let’s have a look at the meaning of the words. “Heritage”
   is a property, something that is inherited, passed down from previous
   generations. In the case of “cultural heritage,” the heritage doesn’t
   consist of money or property, but of culture, values, and traditions.
   Cultural heritage implies a shared bond, our belonging to a community.
   It represents our history and our identity; our bond to the past, to

Tangible and intangible cultural heritage

   Cultural heritage often brings to mind artifacts (paintings, drawings,
   prints, mosaics, sculptures), historical monuments and buildings, as
   well as archaeological sites. But the concept of cultural heritage is
   even wider than that, and has gradually grown to include all evidence
--
   manuscripts, and instruments, etc. either as individual objects or as
   collections. Today, towns, underwater heritage, and the natural
   environment are also considered part of cultural heritage since
   communities identify themselves with the natural landscape.
   Moreover, cultural heritage is not only limited to material objects
   that we can see and touch. It also consists of immaterial elements:
--
   skills transmitted from generation to generation within a community.
   Intangible heritage, therefore, includes a dizzying array of
   traditions, music, and dances such as tango and flamenco, holy

The importance of protecting cultural heritage

   But cultural heritage is not just a set of cultural objects or
   traditions from the past. It is also the result of a selection process:
--
   All peoples make their contribution to the culture of the world. That’s
   why it’s important to respect and safeguard all cultural heritage,
   through national laws and international treaties. Illicit trafficking
--
   and destruction of historical buildings and monuments cause irreparable
   damage to the cultural heritage of a country. UNESCO (United Nations
   Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), founded in 1954,
   has adopted international conventions on the protection of cultural
   heritage, to foster intercultural understanding while stressing the
   importance of international cooperation.
   The protection of cultural property is an old problem. One of the most
   frequently recurring issues in protecting cultural heritage is the
   difficult relationship between the interests of the individual and the

   sixteenth century by Leonardo da Vinci, and displayed at the Musée du
   Louvre in Paris. From a modern point of view, whose national heritage
   does the Mona Lisa belong to?

   Leonardo was a very famous Italian painter, that’s why the Mona Lisa is
   obviously part of the Italian cultural heritage. When Leonardo went to
   France, to work at

   the royal collections: that’s why it is obviously part of the French
   national heritage, too. This painting has been defined as the best
   known, the most visited, the most written about, and the most parodied
   work of art in the world: as such, it belongs to the cultural heritage
   of all mankind.

            The way I see, Culture is a way of life. Or more accurately
            how you live your life. Cultural heritage is a way to catalog
            how the past ways of life flow into what they have become
            today. So yes cultural heritage is a form of history. But
            rather then focusing on dates and facts, cultural heritage
            focuses on intellectual and spiritual humanity.

   Cultural heritage is the heritage of tangible and intangible heritage
   assets of a group or society that is inherited from past generations.
   Not all heritages of past generations are "heritage"; rather, heritage
   is a product of selection by society.^[1]

   Cultural heritage includes tangible culture (such as buildings,
   monuments, landscapes, archive materials, books, works of art, and
   artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language,
   and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant
   landscapes, and biodiversity).^[2] The term is often used in connection

   Cultural property includes the physical, or "tangible" cultural
   heritage, such as artworks. These are generally split into two groups
   of movable and immovable heritage. Immovable heritage includes

   philosophical values of a particular group of people. Naturally,
   intangible cultural heritage is more difficult to preserve than

Natural heritage[edit]

   "Natural heritage" is also an important part of a society's heritage,
   encompassing the countryside and natural environment, including flora

   elements (including mineralogical, geomorphological, paleontological,
   etc.), scientifically known as geodiversity. These kind of heritage
   sites often serve as an important component in a country's tourist
   industry, attracting many visitors from abroad as well as locally.

   New guidance set to help reduce impacts from development on World

   Overview
--

IUCN's work on World Heritage

   IUCN strives to enhance the role of the World Heritage Convention in
   protecting the planet’s biodiversity and promote effective use of its
--
   sites. IUCN's approach to conserving the natural sites inscribed on the
   UNESCO World Heritage List is based on decades of work, expertise and
   partnerships. IUCN is an official advisor to the World Heritage
   Committee. In addition to this statutory role, IUCN assesses the
   conservation prospects of all natural sites through the IUCN World
   Heritage Outlook. IUCN also implements capacity-building initiatives
   through the World Heritage Leadership programme, recognising the
   connections between People-Nature-Culture in managing World Heritage
   sites.

Why is natural World Heritage important?

   World Heritage sites enjoy the highest level of international
   recognition through the 1972 World Heritage Convention, as places so
   valuable that their conservation transcends boundaries, cultures and
   generations. Our ability to secure the highest quality of protection to
   natural World Heritage sites is therefore a litmus test of the
   effectiveness of nature conservation more broadly.

   Although there are relatively few natural World Heritage sites compared
   to other types of protected areas, they cover very large areas that
   represent the best of nature. The 257 sites currently inscribed on the
   World Heritage List for their natural values cover about 7.4% of the
   world’s total protected lands and seas.

   Natural World Heritage sites include iconic places such as the
   Galapagos Islands, the Serengeti, Kilimanjaro, Yellowstone, the Great

   Many recent works try to tackle problems related to culture, cultural

Defining culture, heritage and identity

   What is heritage and identity?

   Questions of heritage and identity are not as straightforward as they
   might first appear. Perhaps the first and best place to begin
   addressing these topics is by acknowledging that in a country like
   South Africa, there is not one heritage, or an easily delineated set of
   distinct identities. The cultures, languages and heritages of South
   Africa are multiple, diverse, and dynamic. Intersectional issues of

   heritage, culture, identity in South Africa and attempt to provide some
   overview of what is meant when people speak of South African Heritage.

   Like 'heritage' and 'identity,' 'culture' is a term that causes much
   confusion and suffers from its misuse. Traditionally it has been used

   World Heritage sites. They are respected and internationally protected
   against harm. Cultural heritage, on the other hand, can be an

   heritage' is used to describe those things that contribute to the sense
   of identity of a particular population or community of people. These

   Cultural heritage sites have to show a masterpiece of human creativity
   or an important exchange of human values over a long period of time.

Key Difference – Ancestry vs Heritage

--
   grandparents, and we are descendants of their ancestry. On the other
   hand, heritage is the inherited customs, traditions, beliefs,
   monuments, and artifacts from our ancestors. Heritage includes both
   physical objects and intangible things. The key difference between
   ancestry and heritage is that the ancestry is the lineage of the people
   while the heritage is the inheritance from the ancestry. In this
   article, we are going to look at the difference between the terms,
   ancestry and heritage, in more detail.

   ancestry vs. heritage
   [INS: :INS]

What is Heritage?

   Heritage deals with cultural inheritance. Material things, as well as
   non-tangible things, can be inherited via culture. Whatever the things
   we inherit from our ancestors can be considered as heritage. Also,
   peoples’ lifestyles are shaped by heritage. That is, we form our
   behaviors according to the habits, lifestyles, ideas, beliefs, and
   practices, etc., inherited from our culture. Heritage can be seen in
   many forms. Natural resources, such as fauna and flora,
   landscapes, land forms, etc. can be considered as natural heritages.
   Artifacts, paintings, jewelry, clothes, and monuments can be described
   as material heritages. Beliefs, values, traditions, ethics, and morals
   are non-physical features that we’ve  inherited. All these things add
   value to humans as a whole, and we all benefit from those heritages.

   An important fact about heritage is that it could be preserved and
   valued as well as it could be destroyed. We can leave our heritages to
   the future generations also if we want. However, heritage is an
   essential part of our current life.

Cultural heritage “in Crisis”

--
   the news media as well as in academic journals on the theme of
   “cultural heritage in crisis.” You could say it’s a booming field.
   But how true is it?
   It’s certainly true that cultural heritage is in danger of destruction,
   looting, or illicit trafficking in many places around the world. It’s
   also true that new types of threats to cultural heritage have developed
   in the last few decades.
--

   Some regions—most recently the heritage-rich areas of the Middle
   East—have certainly experienced a marked increase in illicit
--
   But usage of the term “crisis” to describe the destruction of cultural
   heritage around the world is perhaps a misleading one. “Crisis” is a
   term that indicates a problem that has an urgent, yet temporary
   quality. However, the loss and destruction of cultural heritage is not
   new in human history and is not restricted by the duration of political
--
   United States, face a longstanding and ongoing struggle to protect
   heritage in the face of numerous challenges, regardless of political,
   social, or economic security. It may be worth considering that the idea
   of “crisis” deceptively frames the destruction of heritage as a product
   of temporary instabilities that cease to be a problem once conflicts
   are over. In reality, conditions of “crisis” only really provide new
   opportunities for heritage destruction processes that were already
   happening and will continue happening after the “crisis” is over.

Threats to cultural heritage: war

--
   are two types of threats:
     * destruction of heritage sites and objects caused by war, poverty,
       and development initiatives
--

   In wartime, destruction of heritage sites can be a result of collateral
   damage, for example, when a bomb targeting one location inadvertently
--
   caused by ISIS. However, the majority of damage to cities and to
   heritage has in fact not been caused by ISIS, but by the Syrian
   government’s campaign of relentless aerial bombardment, which has
   destroyed up to 70% of the fabric of the ancient city of Aleppo, a
   UNESCO World Heritage site.
   Walter Hahn, Dresden: view of the destroyed inner city from the town
--
   manuscripts dating back to the 16th century. Deliberate or neglectful
   destruction of heritage has long been a key strategy of war, and
   perpetrators are rarely prosecuted for it.
   The long history of the destruction of heritage shows us that the
   elimination of culture has always been viewed as a powerful tool of
   domination and as a key strategy for eliminating the value humans
   accord to their lives. In recent years, the destruction of heritage —
   whether through war, commercial exploitation, and/or looting — has been
--
   erased. It is not surprising to note, therefore, that the destruction
   of heritage is often a precursor to genocide. This is because in
   denying people their past, perpetrators also deny them a future.

Threats to cultural heritage: development, climate change, tourism, and
natural disasters

   Nevertheless, wartime destruction of heritage is only a small fraction
   of the overall loss of cultural heritage around the world. Much more
   significant and long-lasting is destruction due to urban development,
--
   expand resource extraction on public lands in the United States is also
   causing widespread loss of heritage, as at the Bears Ears National
   Monument, which was controversially reduced by 85% in a decision signed

   Although many heritage sites are preserved in order to encourage
   tourist revenue, tourism can also cause massive destruction because of
--

   If destruction of heritage during wartime is akin to a relatively
   sudden death, looting is like a cancer that slowly erodes it. Looting
   is the theft of heritage items for sale on the antiquities market, most
   often to wealthy private buyers in the United States and Europe. As art
--
   Most importantly, it allows us to focus on the real driver of
   destruction: the demand in wealthy countries for heritage objects — a
   demand that ultimately fuels the entire antiquities trade — and the lax
--
   as that between art — largely considered to be a private commodity
   subject to market demand, versus heritage — which is typically framed
   as “universal” and the patrimony of all.
   Understanding that cultural heritage has been under threat for a very
   long time allows us to avoid short-term, crisis-based responses, and

       peoples are erased. It is not surprising to note, therefore, that
       the destruction of heritage is often a precursor to genocide. This
       is because in denying people their past, perpetrators also deny

       so, the destruction of heritage is certainly causing a psycological
       genocide where one fears any discussion.

       , but in this quest to save cultural heritage, aren't we fighting a
       losing battle? As long as people, who are the basis of everything,
       won't recognize the value of heritage either cultural or of any
       other kind, there would be no point trying to save it.</text>

What is cultural and heritage loss and damage?

   The loss of cultures and heritage is one aspect of non-economic loss
   and damage. Explaining the meaning of heritage, Prof Joanne Clarke, an
   archaeologist specialising in climate change impacts at UEA who

     “Heritage is all the inherited conditions, objects, places and
     culture, as well as contemporary activities, knowledge, meanings and
     behaviours that are drawn from them. Literally, heritage is
     everything that we are and everything that we want to become. So it

How can the loss of cultures and heritage from climate change be measured?

   One of the major themes of the conference was to discuss ways that
   powerful stories of heritage loss from climate change can be properly
   measured and tracked to give an idea of impacts at national,

   Doing this will be crucial to get policymakers to take the issue of
   heritage loss seriously, said Clarke.

   threaten world heritage sites dotted across coastal Africa.

   could triple by 2050, compared to today. Sites at risk include sacred

   Further work is underway to quantify and explain risks facing world
   heritage sites across the world, Clarke told Carbon Brief.

   classified as world heritage sites.

   Another important way to measure and track heritage loss from warming
   is through IPCC reports – the most authoritative source of information

   heritage as an example.

   Clarke told the conference that more must be done to include heritage
   in IPCC reports:
--
     “The [most recent IPCC climate impacts assessment] does not evenly
     or comprehensively incorporate heritage into its discussions around
     loss and damage, even though heritage is fundamental to all seven of
     its central chapters: terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; oceans

   IPCC climate impacts assessment, the chapter on Africa was the only one
   to prominently discuss the impact of climate change on heritage.

--
   Climate and Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town, who
   contributed to the research on world heritage sites in Africa at risk
   from sea level rise, several speakers noted. They added that more could
   be done to ensure heritage is more prominently featured in the next
   assessment cycle.

How can the loss of cultures and heritage be accounted for at UN climate
talks?

   delegates also noted the importance of ensuring it features in the

   risks to heritage within their international climate pledges submitted

Chances and ambitions: the future of young talent in heritage

--
   presentation highlighted the preliminary findings of the research
   project on “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in Heritage.”
   Ordered by the newly founded Stichting Next Gen Heritage, the project
   aims to explore the integration of young professionals into the Dutch
   heritage sector, addressing contemporary challenges such as the
   implications of ageing of many professionals active in heritage, and
   the Faro Convention.
--
   This presentation at the Dutch National Monuments Conference shed light
   on the crucial need for the heritage sector to adapt and evolve,
   embracing the talents and energies of young professionals. The findings
   from “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in Heritage” set the stage
   for future developments and strategic changes in the sector.
--
   The research, which is a part of the broader initiative by the
   Stichting Next Generation Heritage focuses on three critical aspects:
    1. Labor Market Overview: The first part of the presentation detailed
       the diverse nature of the heritage sector, including the
       differences in chains and organizational structures like in built
       and green heritage, archaeology, archives, and museums. Each
       segment has unique needs in education and faces different kinds of
--
       But the research also shows that, at least in the Netherlands,
       heritage is becoming a more and more integral part of bigger
       processes, like city planning or the battle against climate change.
       Thus heritage workers, especially those who work in the public
       sector, increasingly spend their time in multidisciplinary

    2. Youth Perspectives and Aspirations: The presentation zoomed into
       the findings related to higher education students in heritage
       fields. It showed students have a very strong commitment to
       heritage, and is coupled to their active engagement with societal
       issues close to them, ranging from climate change, housing

       professionals in the heritage sector, is characterized by small and
       agile organizations. These organizations are prized for their

    4. Sector’s Current State and Challenges: The final part of the
       presentation addressed how the heritage sector has been operating.

   Implications and Future Directions
   The presentation stressed the need for the heritage sector to become
   more accessible and appealing to young professionals. This involves

   Concluding the presentation, foundation director Herbert-Jan Hiep
   invited stakeholders in the heritage sector from government, industry
   and educational backgrounds, to collaborate with the Stichting Next
   Generation Heritage to create pilot projects. These should explore new
   forms of multidisciplinary and intergeneration cooperation within a
   learning-on-the-job-type environment. The foundation aims to create a
   heritage sector that is innovative, inclusive, and aligned with the
   interests of the next generation, ensuring its vitality and relevance
