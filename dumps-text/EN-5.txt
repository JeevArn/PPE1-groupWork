Chances and ambitions: the future of young talent in heritage

   At the Annual Dutch National Conference on Monuments, an interesting
   presentation highlighted the preliminary findings of the research
   project on “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in Heritage.”
   Ordered by the newly founded Stichting Next Gen Heritage, the project
   aims to explore the integration of young professionals into the Dutch
   heritage sector, addressing contemporary challenges such as the
   implications of ageing of many professionals active in heritage, and
   the Faro Convention.

   This presentation at the Dutch National Monuments Conference shed light
   on the crucial need for the heritage sector to adapt and evolve,
   embracing the talents and energies of young professionals. The findings
   from “Chances and Ambitions for Young Talent in Heritage” set the stage
   for future developments and strategic changes in the sector.

   Key Areas of the Research
   The research, which is a part of the broader initiative by the
   Stichting Next Generation Heritage focuses on three critical aspects:
    1. Labor Market Overview: The first part of the presentation detailed
       the diverse nature of the heritage sector, including the
       differences in chains and organizational structures like in built
       and green heritage, archaeology, archives, and museums. Each
       segment has unique needs in education and faces different kinds of
       shortages like manual labor or administrative positions.
       But the research also shows that, at least in the Netherlands,
       heritage is becoming a more and more integral part of bigger
       processes, like city planning or the battle against climate change.
       Thus heritage workers, especially those who work in the public
       sector, increasingly spend their time in multidisciplinary
       environments and require different skills and different
       combinations of experience and knowledge.
    2. Youth Perspectives and Aspirations: The presentation zoomed into
       the findings related to higher education students in heritage
       fields. It showed students have a very strong commitment to
       heritage, and is coupled to their active engagement with societal
       issues close to them, ranging from climate change, housing
       shortages, to the need for diversity.
       Despite their enthusiasm and ambition to bring change to the
       sector, there’s a clear disconnect between these young aspirants
       and the current state of the heritage sector. Students often
       perceive a lack of visible job opportunities, internships, and
       traineeships in the field. “We don’t notice at all that the sector
       needs young people”, one of the respondents said.
    3. Ideal work environment
       In the same vein, the ideal work environment as defined by young
       professionals in the heritage sector, is characterized by small and
       agile organizations. These organizations are prized for their
       flexibility and their commitment to making a positive contribution
       to the future. Such workplaces are seen as innovative learning
       environments, where young professionals can grow and develop their
       skills.
       Emphasis is also placed on teamwork within these organizations,
       where young professionals feel that their contributions are taken
       seriously and their voices are heard and valued. This preference
       highlights a clear shift towards a more dynamic, inclusive, and
       forward-thinking approach in the workplace.
    4. Sector’s Current State and Challenges: The final part of the
       presentation addressed how the heritage sector has been operating.
       While it has seen success in the past decade, the presentation
       suggested that the sector might be overlooking the need to actively
       adapt to the changing society and the ambitions of the younger
       generation. The mission for the sector is to reevaluate its
       practices and develop, as a community, new strategies to integrate
       young talent effectively.

   Implications and Future Directions
   The presentation stressed the need for the heritage sector to become
   more accessible and appealing to young professionals. This involves
   tailoring jobs to their career aspirations and creating a more flexible
   environment but also adapting them to fit the evolving needs of jobs
   that are increasingly becoming integral part of more complex processes.

   Call for Collaborative Efforts
   Concluding the presentation, foundation director Herbert-Jan Hiep
   invited stakeholders in the heritage sector from government, industry
   and educational backgrounds, to collaborate with the Stichting Next
   Generation Heritage to create pilot projects. These should explore new
   forms of multidisciplinary and intergeneration cooperation within a
   learning-on-the-job-type environment. The foundation aims to create a
   heritage sector that is innovative, inclusive, and aligned with the
   interests of the next generation, ensuring its vitality and relevance
   in the modern world.
