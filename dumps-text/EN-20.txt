   The Heritage Plan 2021-2031 (PDF, 2782KB) covers the conservation and
   management of the important things we want to pass on to future
   generations.

Purpose

   The heritage plan provides council with a framework to guide the
   identification, protection, conservation and management of the region’s
   heritage. The plan will ensure that council effectively manages and
   conserves the region’s heritage assets.

Overview

   The heritage plan covers all aspects of the Sunshine Coast’s cultural
   and natural heritage, which council has direct responsibility for or
   influence over.

   The plan's vision declares that ‘our heritage is our gift for the
   future’. It has been structured around the five outcome areas of:
     * knowledge
     * conservation
     * support
     * communication
     * advocacy.

   The implementation plan guides council's actions for the duration of 10
   years.

Community engagement

   Extensive consultation was conducted with external stakeholders
   including:
     * traditional owners and custodians
     * representatives from the heritage sector
     * Sunshine Coast heritage reference group.

   Peer reviews were undertaken by:
     * Queensland Department of Environment and Science
     * National Trust of Australia (Queensland)
     * Queensland Museum
     * Queensland Heritage Council.

   The Heritage Plan 2021-2031 is based on the framework of the Sunshine
   Coast Heritage Plan 2015-2020 (PDF, 8452KB).
