          + Protecting cultural heritage

   Cultural property is part of our heritage, history and identity. It
   needs protecting from criminals.

   Trafficking in cultural property is a low-risk, high-profit business
   for criminals with links to organized crime.

   From stolen artwork to historical artefacts, this crime can affect all
   countries, either as origin, transit or destinations.
