             Christopher Gomez


   The Board of Directors for Heritage Family Credit Union announced the
   appointment of Christopher Gomez as the credit union’s next
   President/CEO on Tuesday, Oct. 17. Gomez will take over the reins from
   the current retiring president/CEO Matthew Levandowski, on Monday, Nov.
   6, 2023.

   “The Board of Directors is very excited to welcome Chris to Heritage
   Family Credit Union as our next President/CEO. Chris stood out amongst
   a very strong set of candidates and has demonstrated a deeply held
   passion for the credit union movement. He brings more than 20 years of
   industry experience and a wealth of knowledge to our organization.
   Chris is committed to providing world class service and value to our
   members, and we look forward to the continued success and growth of
   Heritage Family under his leadership,” said Kevin Loso, Chairperson of
   the Board of Directors.”

   Gomez will be moving to the Rutland community with his wife and
   daughter from upstate New York, where he most recently served as the
   chief experience officer for Mid-Hudson Valley Federal Credit Union.
   Beyond his professional responsibilities, Gomez served his community as
   an active volunteer and served on several non-profit boards in
   leadership positions.

   “I am extremely honored and excited to have the opportunity to lead the
   continued growth and prosperity of one of Vermont’s premier financial
   institutions. I look forward to working with tahe board, leadership
   team, and staff on delivering on our mission and providing valuable
   service to the members of Heritage Family Credit Union,” said Gomez.

   The Board engaged Shanley Search Partners to conduct a nationwide
   search for candidates.

   Gomez was chosen from over 50 qualified applicants for the role. He
   takes over the leadership of the credit union from outgoing
   President/CEO Levandowski who had a career spanning 30 years at
   Heritage Family Credit Union, serving as the leader for the last 10.
   Levandowski served under Ron Hance who held the position for over four
   decades.

   Heritage Family Credit Union was formed in 1956 as the Ludlow Rutland
   General Electric Employees’ Credit Union and has $740 million in assets
   serving 50,000 members in the southern half of Vermont, parts of New
   Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts.
