Welcome

   The Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program (PNHP) is a partnership
   between the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural
   Resources (DCNR), the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC), the
   Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC), and the Western Pennsylvania
   Conservancy (WPC) in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service. PNHP is a member of NatureServe, an international network of
   natural heritage programs that gather and provide information on the
   location and status of important ecological resources (plants,
   vertebrates, invertebrates, ecological communities and geologic
   features). Our purpose is to provide current, reliable, objective
   ecological data and analysis to help guide conservation work and
   land-use planning.
