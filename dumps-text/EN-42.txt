Defining culture, heritage and identity

     * [african-masks-johannesburg-market-south-africa.jpg?itok=7y8UFac1]

   What is heritage and identity?

   Questions of heritage and identity are not as straightforward as they
   might first appear. Perhaps the first and best place to begin
   addressing these topics is by acknowledging that in a country like
   South Africa, there is not one heritage, or an easily delineated set of
   distinct identities. The cultures, languages and heritages of South
   Africa are multiple, diverse, and dynamic. Intersectional issues of
   gender, ethnicity, and race further complicate the matter of identity
   and make it highly inadvisable to categorise the different people
   contained within South Africa’s borders. This is especially true in the
   wake of segregationsit Apartheid policies which attempted to divide and
   conquer the majority of the country's population by emphasising the
   ontological immiscibility of different races.

   South Africa is heir to a legacy of autochthonous livelihoods (see,
   most famously, the Khoi and the San) as well as Bantu immigration;
   slavery; colonisation; settler economies; and liberation movements.
   These histories have all had a drastic effect on the make up of South
   Africa's population. Yet somehow through the interchange of cultures
   and sharing of cultural influences in the age of globalisation, there
   defiantly remains a tapestry of phenomena which can identifiably and
   unabmiguously to termed 'South Africa.' In this article we look at
   heritage, culture, identity in South Africa and attempt to provide some
   overview of what is meant when people speak of South African Heritage.

   Culture

   Like 'heritage' and 'identity,' 'culture' is a term that causes much
   confusion and suffers from its misuse. Traditionally it has been used
   to refer to the ways of life of a specific group of people, including
   various ways of behaving, belief systems, values, customs, dress,
   personal decoration, social relationships, religion, symbols and codes.
   The pitfalls of the term are however, considerable. For instance, it is
   not unusal for European visitors to South Africa or Africa at large, to
   innocently enquire into the nature of "African Culture." Such an
   enquiry clearly makes little sense, for the Xhosa, Zulu, Pedi, Dinka,
   Himba, Berber, Arab, and so forth all represent vastly different modes
   of practice and have little in common save for the relative geographic
   proximity in relation to the rest of the globe. Even to ask about 'Zulu
   culture' is potentially wide of the mark, given how varied and dynamic
   the Zulu population is. While it is a stretch of the imagination to
   state that culture simply does not exist, as has been claimed by
   certain postmodern intellectuals, it remains difficult to reach a
   consensus about what the term really denotes. Is there such a thing as
   'White culture' or 'Coloured culture,' for instance?

   Throughout history, various people and institutions have attempted to
   define what is meant by culture. In 1871, one of the fathers of British
   social anthropology, Edward Burnett Tylor attempted to describe it in
   the following way: "Culture or civilization, taken in its wide
   ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge,
   belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits
   acquired by man as a member of society." More recently, the United
   Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
   (2002) described culture as follows: "... culture should be regarded as
   the set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional
   features of society or a social group, and that it encompasses, in
   addition to art and literature, lifestyles, ways of living together,
   value systems, traditions and beliefs." Once one begins to search for
   an adequate definition of culture, one quickly realises that there are
   so many to choose from it is virtually impossible to decide which one
   is best.

   In South Africa, the question of definition according to race and
   culture carries an especially sharp edge to it, which potentially makes
   it a more contentious issue here than elsewhere. This is primarily due
   to the policies of the Apartheid government that sought to distinguish
   and segregate the country according to rigid definitions of race
   between 1948-1991. These policies reached their apotheosis in the
   establishment of the 'Bantustans,' which were created as homelands for
   the major different ethnic groups represented within South Africa's
   borders. For this reason, subsequent attempts to define the people of
   South Africa may easily carry an unpleasant connotation of racist
   categorisation from the past. With this proviso, South Africa has a
   hugely diverse population, representative of a vast spectrum of
   different languages, practices, and values.

   Culture in South Africa

   South Africa has been famously referred to as the rainbow nation
   because it is made up of so many diverse cultures and religions.
   Contained within South Africa's borders are Zulu, Xhosa, Pedi, Tswana,
   Ndebele, Khoisan, Hindu, Muslim, and Afrikaner people to name but a
   few. All of these people are united by calling South Africa home, and
   therefore their lives all contribute to forming a part of the country’s
   heritage, identity and culture. Understanding that South Africa is
   composed of all these various influences is essential for helping South
   Africans to understand and respect each other and to learn from each
   other’s cultural practices. This is part of the healing that democracy
   has brought after culture was used to divide South Africans in the
   past.

   Identity

   A person’s identity is made up of their own character combined with
   their family and social roots. Identity, like culture, is ever
   changing. For example a person can be a teacher, parent, spouse and
   driver to their children, as well as being a famous politician fighting
   for justice or a farmer growing crops for food. To this person it is
   possible to be all of these and much more. At the same time being a
   person of a particular race or class also influences one's identity.
   When people speak of 'intersectionality,' they are broadly referring to
   this way that a single person can be at the intersection of multiple
   different social identities. The experiences of a White, heterosexual,
   urban, and middle-class mother, for instance, will be vastly different
   to that of a Black, homosexual, rural, and working class single woman.
   Identity, in short, is made up of a multitude of factors and an
   individual is both subject to their circumstance and an agent able to
   influence which parts of themselves they present to the world.

   Heritage

   Heritage might be best broken up into two types: natural and cultural.
   A country’s natural heritage is its environment and natural resources,
   like gold and water. Areas that are very special and where animals or
   plants are in danger of extinction like the St. Lucia Wetlands and
   uKhahlamba Drakensberg Parks in KwaZulu Natal are often designated
   World Heritage sites. They are respected and internationally protected
   against harm. Cultural heritage, on the other hand, can be an
   altogether more contentious issue. Normally, the term 'cultural
   heritage' is used to describe those things that contribute to the sense
   of identity of a particular population or community of people. These
   can be special monuments, like a building, sculpture, painting, a cave
   dwelling or anything important because of its history, artistic or
   scientific value. The area in which this can become problematic is when
   a part of somebody's cultural heritage seems to clash directly with the
   dignity of another person's, or where it appears to transgress
   established global human rights practices (as set out in the Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights). An example might be the practice of
   female genital mutilation or the display of monuments that celebrate
   the lives of people who were responsible for the deaths of vast numbers
   of people, such as Cecil John Rhodes.

   Heritage and the South African Constitution

   A constitution is the guiding law on a country's values and rules. A
   constitution directs the government and all the people who live in a
   country on the rules for how citizens should be treated and how they
   should treat others. A constitution supports and protects a country and
   the heritage and culture of its peoples. South Africa is widely
   considered to have one of the fairest and most progressive
   constitutions in the world.

   In South Africa the vision of the constitution is for everybody to be
   equal. This means that nobody should be permitted to discriminate
   against anyone else because of things like skin colour, age, religion,
   language or gender. South Africans have human rights that are
   protected. For example, some schools have turned away children who have
   AIDS. However, the law protects these children’s rights to an
   education. In the same way the right to practice different religious
   beliefs is protected. Every person has the right to be part of any
   religion and to use the language of their choice. For this reason South
   Africa has 11 official languages so that all the major languages used
   in the country are given recognition. These languages are Sepedi,
   Sesotho, Setswana, siSwati, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, Afrikaans, English,
   isiNdebele, isiXhosa and isiZulu. Languages used by smaller groups such
   as the Khoi, Nama, San and sign language must also be respected under
   the constitution. Other languages used in South Africa include Shona,
   French, Swahili, Lingala, Portuguese, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hindi,
   Tamil, Portuguese, Telegu and Urdu. Other languages like Arabic, Hebrew
   and Sanskrit, used in certain religions, must also be respected.

   World Heritage Sites in South Africa

   A World Heritage Site is declared by the United Nations Educational,
   Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). There are two types of
   World Heritage Sites: the first represents cultural and the second
   natural heritage.

   Cultural sites

   Cultural heritage sites have to show a masterpiece of human creativity
   or an important exchange of human values over a long period of time.
   This exchange must be seen in architecture or technology, the planning
   of the town or city and the design of the landscape. It has to show
   evidence of a tradition or civilisation that has disappeared or is
   still alive. It can also be a very good example of a type of building,
   group of buildings, and use of technology or reflect important stages
   in human history.

   A place where humans settled and used the land in a way that represents
   their culture can also be a cultural heritage site, especially if the
   area is affected by change that cannot be reversed. The authenticity
   and the way the site is protected and managed are also important
   factors.

   Natural sites

   Natural sites that can be considered to become World Heritage Sites
   must display major stages in the earth’s history. They can be in
   fossils, rocks or other geological features.

   If an area contains rare natural formations, like unique rock shapes,
   or is very beautiful, or has habitats and species of animals and plants
   that can only exist there, it becomes important to protect it. This
   also makes it a possible World Heritage Site. As with cultural sites,
   preservation is very important.

   Some special places fall into both cultural and natural heritage sites
   and in 1992 UNESCO decided that places that show the relationship
   between people and their environment could also be cultural landscapes.

   South Africa has 8 places declared as World Heritage Sites. These are:
    1. The iSimangaliso Greater St. Lucia Wetland Park
    2. The uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park
    3. Robben Island
    4. The Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai and
       environs
    5. The Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape
    6. Vredefort Dome
    7. The Cape Floral Region
    8. The Richtersveld Cultural and Botanical Landscape
