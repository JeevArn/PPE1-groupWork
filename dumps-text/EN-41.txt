HERITAGE - The Material Cultural Heritage as a Strategic Territorial
Development Resource: Mapping Impacts Through a Set of Common European
Socio-economic Indicators

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/1BYiYroo8mU

   Theme: cultural heritage, territorial impact, indicators, monitoring
   and evaluation

Scope

   The service shall attempt to quantify the contribution (impact) of
   material cultural heritage to economical development in the stakeholder
   countries and regions over the past 5 years. Building on the work done
   by the European Heritage Heads Forum’s Economic Task Force and the
   European Commission, this research activity will define a list of
   economic sectors on which the material cultural heritage has an impact
   and perform data collection on the selected impact indicators.

   The main outcome should be a common theoretical framework, defining the
   most important economic sectors on which the material cultural heritage
   has an impact and developing the empirical evidence of such impact.
   This research activity will also develop a blueprint or in other words
   a step-by-step plan on how to build a monitoring system in the
   stakeholder countries that includes all actions necessary to obtain and
   maintain data for the defined impact indicators in the future.

   This study is named as one of the key studies by the “European
   Framework for Action on Cultural Heritage” (adopted by the European
   Commission in December 2018). Economic statistics and indicators
   produced will be useful for understanding the economic contribution of
   the material cultural heritage. Overall the results will promote
   evidence-based decision making related to protection and promotion of
   material cultural heritage.

Main outcomes

     * A common theoretical framework defining the economic sectors on
       which material cultural heritage has an impact.
     * A common methodological framework describing how to determine the
       impact material cultural heritage has on these economic sectors.
     * Evidence (collected data and set of indicators) on the economic
       impact of cultural heritage in stakeholder territories / regions
       over the past 5 years (for example e.g. cultural heritage-related
       gross value added in tourism, construction, etc.).
     * Step-by-step plan on how to develop a monitoring system (at the
       territorial level) to be used in the stakeholder countries, that
       includes all actions necessary to obtain data of the defined
       socio-economic impact indicators, building time series and checking
       and reporting the status of the indicators on a regular basis. It
       should also include an operational description of the data
       generating and reporting procedures
