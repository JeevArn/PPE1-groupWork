MISSION - TO IMPROVE THE METHODS OF CULTURAL HERITAGE PRESERVATION

   In order to realize our mission in the first five years of work we’ve
   promoted and developed best practices of digital technologies
   implementation in the sphere of heritage preservation. Open >

   Our main activities:
     * created a virtual tour of archaeological excavations under Poshtova
       Square in Kyiv;
     * Duke of Richelieu and famous monuments of Ukraine were placed in
       cinema, AR, VR and even holograms;
     * Scanned and manufactured models of monuments for 7 bronze models in
       Odesa and Kropyvnytskyi;
     * Implemented Very Digital Residences, which became one of the 5
       nominees for the 2020 UCF Digital Project of the Year Award.
     * Became speakers at more than 40 high-level and local events,
       including TEDx, annual forums of the Ministry of Culture of
       Ukraine, scientific conferences.



   But we are no longer promoting digital preservation.

   Now, in the 2020s, there are already companies in Ukraine that scan and
   model, work with digital passports of heritage — projects in BIM. The
   state also shows by its actions that digitalization is a priority and
   won’t be avoided.


   Therefore, we have a new mission — to improve the methods of preserving
   cultural heritage. What it implies for our institutional activities:
     * Training of multisectoral specialists, including artists and
       officials, architects and photographers, reporters and activists;
     * Developing new production chains between workshops and hubs across
       the country and abroad;
     * Implementation of digital décor restoration and digital passports
       during restoration;
     * Supporting collection of the Ukrainian database of heritage in the
       format of digital twins of cities and buildings;
     * Stimulating business and creative industries cooperation around
       digital heritage.



   We are operating from Odesa, Ukraine, and have team members in Italy,
   Germany and other countries. We are open to working with cities and
   cultural institutions, businesses and artists, experts and activists.
   If you care about cultural heritage, join our mission and implement new
   digital projects with us.

   Transform your liability into your legacy working as an asset of your
   community in a course of few years.
    1. Attract the attention of tourists with innovative visualization of
       the monument, recreate its historical appearance and present it in
       augmented reality. The next step is to turn the 3D model into a
       real layout made of bronze, wood, or plastic.
    2. Open access for local entrepreneurs to create original souvenirs on
       the terms of receiving royalties.
    3. With architects, urbanists and the community, develop a
       participatory project to fill the monument with life.
    4. Present a revitalized memo to investors and involve large
       businesses or funds in the restoration.
    5. We support cultural projects from the concept stage to the search
       for funding (grants, government competitions, tenders, joint
       funds).
    6. Consult on the possibilities and limitations of digital cultural
       projects;
    7. Find support in writing applications, communications, and
       administration;

   One of the crucial benefits of digital production is the time saved,
   which can be used to work on creative ideas. Work with traditional
   media and sketch in plasticine, clay, or found objects. Scanning solves
   the problem of scaling and making changes to the layout in the next
   stages of production.
    1. Scan the sketch from a material convenient for you and get a 3D
       model;
    2. Make changes yourself or in collaboration with our 3D artist;
    3. Visualize the future work in the material and at the location;
    4. 3D print a casting mold, that saves materials and production steps;
    5. Ростіть місцеві таланти завдяки семінарам та курсам з цифрового
       виробництва.
