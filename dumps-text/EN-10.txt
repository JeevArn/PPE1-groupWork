   Sure, “Succession” may have ended earlier this year, but that doesn’t
   mean Waystar Royco doesn’t have one last deal to close.

   The viral Emmy-winning HBO series is at the center of an upcoming
   auction to be held by Heritage auction house January 13. Hundreds of
   props, set decorations, and costumes from the show will be available
   for purchase through Heritage Screenbid in conjunction with HBO as part
   of a special pre-Emmys “Succession” Showcase Auction.

   “This is a singular opportunity for fans to own something iconic from
   one of their favorite characters or sets,” Heritage Screenbid’s
   managing director Jax Strobel said. “Who wouldn’t want to own the
   ludicrously capricious bag or a pair of Kendall or Greg’s sunglasses —
   or, for that matter, all of it? And, of course, who ever imagined they
   could play their own game of Boar on the Floor, complete with prop
   sausages? Truly, there is something for everyone who loved this show,
   which is anyone who watched a second of ‘Succession.'”

   October 16, marking the occasion with the release of a short film
   featuring more than 500 characters from 85 films. Disneyland Paris
   marked that anniversary with a parade showcasing a hundred of Disney's
   characters. (Photo by Ian LANGSDON / AFP) (Photo by IAN LANGSDON/AFP

   The infamous “Ludicrously Capacious Bag,” aka a $3,000 Burberry tote,
   will be among the hot ticket items, as well as Kendall Roy’s (Jeremy
   Strong) sneaker collection and the wedding tux worn by Connor (Alan
   Ruck) during his ill-fated nuptials. Luxury brands like Lanvin, Canali,
   Tom Ford, Alexander McQueen, Brioni, and Max Mara are the staple pieces
   found in the Roy family’s closet, and now any bidders’ as well.

   The subversive sartorial decision to clothe Roman (Kieran Culkin) in a
   Walmart t-shirt when he left to mourn the loss of his father Logan
   (Brian Cox) at his Barbados home became iconic costuming; that Walmart
   outfit worn by Culkin can also be bid on.

   Outside of costumes, props like the note Shiv (Sarah Snook) read to the
   media upon Logan’s death will be auctioned, as well as the pink note
   cards Roman used to pen the eulogy to Logan. The fictional covers of
   Forbes, Vanity Fair, and New York Magazine that featured the rise and
   fall (and, arguably, rise again) of the Waystar Royco empire can also
   be bought, plus characters’ company ID badges and the furnishings of
   Logan’s office. Plus, the scorpion gift that Shiv found repulsive is up
   for auction just in time for Valentine’s Day.

   “Succession” made history with the most 2024 Golden Globe nominations
   for a TV series. The show is also nominated for 27 2024 Emmy Awards,
   including 14 acting nods for the cast.
