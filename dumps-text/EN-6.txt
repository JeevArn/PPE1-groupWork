Abstract

   The advance of all forms of digital and virtual heritage alongside
   numerous heritage science and management applications have led to the
   generation of growing amounts of heritage data. This data is
   increasingly rich, diverse and powerful. To get the most out of
   heritage data, there is an evident need to effectively understand,
   manage and exploit it in a way that is sensitive towards its context,
   responding to its singularities, and that can allow heritage to keep up
   with global changes regarding expansion of digital technologies and the
   increasing role of data in decision making and policy development.
   Through conversations with industry and academia, as well as through
   their personal research in the field of cultural heritage, the authors
   have identified a need for enhanced training for data scientists to
   prepare them for working in the heritage sector. This paper first
   proposes a definition of the term heritage data, so far missing from
   the literature, and then presents the academic rationale behind the
   identified need for targeted training in data science for cultural
   heritage.
