The highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant BA.2.86 is still neutralized by
antibodies in the blood
            The spike protein of BA.2.86 — a subvariant of Omicron — has a
            large number of mutations, and binds to its receptor in host
            cells with high affinity. Despite these characteristics,
            BA.2.86 is no more resistant to antibodies from vaccinated
            individuals than are the dominant variants that are currently
            in circulation.
