Loss and damage: How can culture and heritage loss be measured and addressed?

   By Daisy Dunne, originally published by Carbon Brief

   April 10, 2023
   coastal erosion

   A group of archaeologists, climate scientists and policy experts met at
   the University of East Anglia last week to discuss how unique cultures
   and heritage are fast disappearing because of climate change ‚Äì and what
   can be done to properly measure and address this.

   From the erosion of the Norfolk seaside to the inundation of ancestral
   desert land in Mauritania, climate change is already having a serious
   and often irreversible impact on people‚Äôs cultures and heritage.

   Such impacts are one aspect of ‚Äúloss and damage‚Äù ‚Äì a term used to
   describe the consequences of climate change that can no longer be
   avoided, which tend to be heaped on vulnerable communities.

   After the historic agreement on a fund for loss and damage at the COP27
   climate summit in 2022, researchers met to discuss how to ensure
   the loss of cultures and heritage can be included in high-level climate
   discussions.

   Carbon Brief was at the event to listen to the talks and discussion and
   has summarised the key takeaways.

What is cultural and heritage loss and damage?

   ‚ÄúLoss and damage‚Äù is a term used to describe how climate change is
   already causing serious and, in many cases, irreversible impacts around
   the world ‚Äì particularly in vulnerable communities. At UN climate
   talks, the term is often used by groups arguing for big historic
   emitters to be held responsible for losses incurred in poorer regions,
   which are the least responsible for climate change.

   Loss and damage can be caused by immediate climate impacts, such
   as more intense and frequent extreme weather events, as well as impacts
   that gradually worsen over time, such as sea level rise, enhanced
   coastal erosion and the retreat of glaciers.

   According to the most recent assessment of climate impacts from
   the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), loss and damage
   can broadly be split into two categories: economic losses involving
   ‚Äúincome and physical assets‚Äù; and non-economic losses, which include ‚Äì
   but are not limited to ‚Äì ‚Äúmortality, mobility and mental wellbeing
   losses‚Äù.

   The loss of cultures and heritage is one aspect of non-economic loss
   and damage. Explaining the meaning of heritage, Prof Joanne Clarke, an
   archaeologist specialising in climate change impacts at UEA who
   organised the conference, told delegates:

     ‚ÄúHeritage is all the inherited conditions, objects, places and
     culture, as well as contemporary activities, knowledge, meanings and
     behaviours that are drawn from them. Literally, heritage is
     everything that we are and everything that we want to become. So it
     is crucial for the preservation of society and social wellbeing. And
     it is increasingly thought to offer recognition to underrepresented
     populations.‚Äù

   At the conference, speakers detailed how climate change is already
   affecting culture and heritage across the world, including in Ghana,
   Mauritania, Vietnam, Bangladesh and the UK.

   Prof Kwasi Appeaning Addo, director of the Institute for Environment
   and Sanitation Studies (IESS) at the University of Ghana, explained how
   climate change is already affecting sites of cultural significance in
   coastal Ghana, including historic slave forts. He told the conference:

     ‚ÄúErosion, sea level rise and flooding are a major threat to heritage
     sites ‚Äì and a major threat to vulnerable communities within our
     coastal regions.‚Äù

     Really thrilled to be at @uniofeastanglia for a @BritishAcademy_
     conference on heritage loss and damage from climate change üåäüå¥

   To illustrate the scale of coastal erosion in Ghana, he showed
   delegates images of a coastline in 2008 and 2021 (shown in the tweet
   above). He told delegates:

     ‚ÄúIn 2008, I drove on this road. In 2021 I went back and the road was
     gone.‚Äù

   Dr Salma Sabour, a postdoctoral researcher of heritage loss from
   climate change at the University of Southampton, explained her work
   examining climate impacts in Banc d‚ÄôArguin National Park, Mauritania.

   As well as being one of the most important fish nurseries in West
   Africa and a significant breeding site in the ‚ÄúEast Atlantic Flyway‚Äù
   for migratory birds, the coastal desert site is also the ancestral home
   of the Imraguen people, she explained.

   This Indigenous community is highly adapted to life in the coastal
   desert and carries out many traditional fishing practices, including
   blowing on seashells to attract dolphins, who bring fish with them.

   However, sea level rise is already threatening the Imraguen‚Äôs unique
   way of life, causing their villages to become inundated with seawater
   for months at a time. She told the conference:

     ‚ÄúImagine seeing your village becoming an island for three to six
     months of the year.‚Äù

   Dr Sophie Day, a senior researcher at the UEA‚Äôs Tyndall Centre on
   secondment to North Norfolk District Council, spoke about her work
   examining cultural and heritage loss from climate change along the
   Norfolk coast in the UK.

   One place particularly affected by coastal erosion in Norfolk is the
   seaside village of Hemsby.

   The village has lost about 70 metres of coastline in the last 50 years,
   with damage from storm surges and high tides increasing over time. In
   March 2018, the village was struck by a powerful storm dubbed the
   ‚ÄúBeast from the East‚Äù, which caused seven homes to fall into the sea.

   Day told the conference she asked residents of Norfolk‚Äôs rapidly
   eroding seaside villages to explain what the loss of heritage from
   climate change means to them. In response, residents raised fears about
   losing a sense of place, sites for recreation, archaeology sites,
   churches and graveyards, and natural habitats, among other things, she
   said.

How can the loss of cultures and heritage from climate change be measured?

   One of the major themes of the conference was to discuss ways that
   powerful stories of heritage loss from climate change can be properly
   measured and tracked to give an idea of impacts at national,
   continental and global scales.

   Doing this will be crucial to get policymakers to take the issue of
   heritage loss seriously, said Clarke.

   She told the conference about a study she was involved in that ‚Äì for
   the first time ‚Äì comprehensively assessed how sea level rise could
   threaten world heritage sites dotted across coastal Africa.

   The research ‚Äì which Carbon Brief covered in depth ‚Äì revealed that the
   number of world heritage sites at risk from sea level rise in Africa
   could triple by 2050, compared to today. Sites at risk include sacred
   waterfalls, second-century trading posts and biodiversity hotspots.

   Previous research by a similar group of scientists also mapped out the
   risks facing world heritage sites in the Mediterranean, ranging from
   the iconic ancient cities of Venice and Naples to caves containing
   Neandertal artwork in Gibraltar.

   Further work is underway to quantify and explain risks facing world
   heritage sites across the world, Clarke told Carbon Brief.

   Speaking from the audience, Nusrat Naushin, coordinator of the loss and
   damage programme at the International Centre for Climate Change and
   Development in Bangladesh, questioned whether such an approach could be
   expanded to include sites of cultural importance that are not
   classified as world heritage sites.

   As an example, she told the conference about a tree in Bangladesh that
   was considered sacred to those following the Hindu faith. The tree was
   washed away in a flash flood, she told the audience, with no authority
   or actor being held accountable for this cultural loss.

   Another important way to measure and track heritage loss from warming
   is through IPCC reports ‚Äì the most authoritative source of information
   on climate change, said Clarke.

   As noted above, the IPCC‚Äôs most recent climate impacts assessment does
   discuss non-economic loss and damage, but does not explicitly mention
   heritage as an example.

   Clarke told the conference that more must be done to include heritage
   in IPCC reports:

     ‚ÄúThe [most recent IPCC climate impacts assessment] does not evenly
     or comprehensively incorporate heritage into its discussions around
     loss and damage, even though heritage is fundamental to all seven of
     its central chapters: terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems; oceans
     and coastal ecosystems; water; food and fibre; cities and
     settlements; health and wellbeing; economics, poverty and
     livelihoods.‚Äù

   In a discussion, Sabour noted that, out of the regional chapters of the
   IPCC climate impacts assessment, the chapter on Africa was the only one
   to prominently discuss the impact of climate change on heritage.

   This likely reflected the personal interests of one of chapter‚Äôs lead
   authors, Dr Nick Simpson, a postdoctoral research fellow at the African
   Climate and Development Initiative at the University of Cape Town, who
   contributed to the research on world heritage sites in Africa at risk
   from sea level rise, several speakers noted. They added that more could
   be done to ensure heritage is more prominently featured in the next
   assessment cycle.

How can the loss of cultures and heritage be accounted for at UN climate
talks?

   As well as discussing how to get heritage into IPCC reports, the
   delegates also noted the importance of ensuring it features in the
   burgeoning loss and damage movement making waves at UN climate talks.

   COP27 in Egypt saw countries reach a landmark deal on a loss and damage
   fund following a 30-year struggle largely led by small island states
   and developing countries.

   Speaking to Carbon Brief in 2022, Sandeep Chamling Rai, a senior
   advisor at WWF and an expert on the UN climate change non-economic loss
   and damage taskforce, said that the loss of cultural heritage has so
   far been neglected at UN climate talks, with most looking at loss and
   damage from a ‚Äúmonetary point of view‚Äù.

   At the conference, Dr Hannah Fluck, an archaeologist working on climate
   change and heritage who co-chairs the Climate Heritage Network, said
   the organisation was looking for volunteers to help get heritage spoken
   about in negotiation rooms at COP28 later this year.

   Elsewhere at the conference, Dr Nick Brooks, a climate scientist and
   director of Garama 3C, a small consultancy firm for climate change and
   development, suggested that countries should be encouraged to include
   risks to heritage within their international climate pledges submitted
   to the UN (known as ‚Äúnationally determined contributions‚Äù or NDCs).

     Countries could include the heritage sites and cultural aspects at
     risk from climate change in their national climate plans (NDCs) as a
     first step to quantifying global-scale risks, says Dr Nick Brooks

     Could also help include heritage in loss and damage funding

   Doing this could be a first step towards quantifying global heritage
   risks in a UN context, he added.
