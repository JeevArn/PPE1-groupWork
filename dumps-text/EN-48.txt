Heritage Estate Planning Services

   Estate planning is a more complex undertaking than many people realize,
   involving emotional as well as financial decisions. Contrary to
   prevalent misconception, estate planning is not only for those with
   substantial wealth or of advanced age. We advise Individuals and
   couples across the board to take the time to prepare for the future
   since it often arrives much more quickly than we anticipate.
   At Heritage Legal our whole team is well aware that our estate planning
   clients are dealing with sensitive issues that will affect not only
   their assets, but their healthcare, their legacy, and their loved ones.
   For this reason, we take our mission very seriously. We offer
   comprehensive estate planning services to clients with varying assets
   and a wide variety of special concerns.
   Probates & Trust Administration

   Our estate planning services include:
   Creating wills to designate beneficiaries and an executor to manage
   asset distribution
   Planning for charitable giving by various means
   Handling probate
   Planning for business succession of LLCs and FLPs
   Helping you to avoid probate in order to prevent excessive taxation and
   delays
   Providing fiduciary services
   Establishing trusts to protect assets and provide for special
   circumstances
   Assisting executors and trustees in performing their duties

   Probates & Trust Administration

   One of the chief advantages of working with a talented estate planning
   attorney like Chris Heritage is that he will direct you to areas you
   may not have thought to consider and help you to resolve problems you
   didn’t know were solvable. For example, he will be able to craft
   revocable and irrevocable trusts that may be useful to you in
   particular circumstances and will be able to clarify the differences
   between them. He will also assist you in establishing trusts for
   beneficiaries who have special needs, such as medical or psychiatric
   disabilities, or who are, because of extravagant spending, substance
   abuse, or gambling addiction, unable to manage their inheritance in
   such a way that it will remain available to meet their long-term needs.
