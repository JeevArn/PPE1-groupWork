World Heritage

   IUCN is the official advisor on nature under the World Heritage
   Convention. Natural World Heritage sites are recognised as the most
   significant protected areas. They provide life-supporting benefits to
   people and the planet, yet face increasing threats. Our ability to
   secure the highest quality of protection to these sites is a litmus
   test of the effectiveness of nature conservation more broadly.

IUCN's work on World Heritage

   IUCN strives to enhance the role of the World Heritage Convention in
   protecting the planet’s biodiversity and promote effective use of its
   mechanisms to strengthen the conservation and management of natural
   sites. IUCN's approach to conserving the natural sites inscribed on the
   UNESCO World Heritage List is based on decades of work, expertise and
   partnerships. IUCN is an official advisor to the World Heritage
   Committee. In addition to this statutory role, IUCN assesses the
   conservation prospects of all natural sites through the IUCN World
   Heritage Outlook. IUCN also implements capacity-building initiatives
   through the World Heritage Leadership programme, recognising the
   connections between People-Nature-Culture in managing World Heritage
   sites.

Why is natural World Heritage important?

   World Heritage sites enjoy the highest level of international
   recognition through the 1972 World Heritage Convention, as places so
   valuable that their conservation transcends boundaries, cultures and
   generations. Our ability to secure the highest quality of protection to
   natural World Heritage sites is therefore a litmus test of the
   effectiveness of nature conservation more broadly.

   Although there are relatively few natural World Heritage sites compared
   to other types of protected areas, they cover very large areas that
   represent the best of nature. The 257 sites currently inscribed on the
   World Heritage List for their natural values cover about 7.4% of the
   world’s total protected lands and seas.

   Natural World Heritage sites include iconic places such as the
   Galapagos Islands, the Serengeti, Kilimanjaro, Yellowstone, the Great
   Barrier Reef and Ha Long Bay. They are areas of stunning natural
   beauty, which not only harbour unique ecosystems and rare species, but
   also reflect a collective commitment to safeguarding the planet’s most
   precious places for future generations.

Impact assessment

   Assessing the impacts of projects likely to affect World Heritage sites
   –before deciding to proceed with them– is essential to prevent damage
   on natural values and identify sustainable options.

   Thematic studies

   IUCN regularly conducts and updates thematic studies to help States
   Parties and interested stakeholders assess the potential for nominating
   candidate sites to the World Heritage List. These include analyses of
   possible gaps by region or by type of ecosystem.
