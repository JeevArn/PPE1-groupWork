   The Heritage Foundation

Join the most influential conservative group in America

   For 50 years, The Heritage Foundation has led the conservative
   movement. Now you can be part of this exclusive group.

   Become Part of a Movement That Can Transform America

   Free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional
   American values, and a strong national defense—these are the values
   that we fight for every single day. As the nation’s largest, most
   broadly-supported think tank, The Heritage Foundation has long been the
   bastion of the American conservative movement. And with more than
   500,000 members, our ranks are growing stronger every day. And now, you
   can join us and help to ensure that your values are being advanced in
   Washington, in the Media, and across this great nation.

   America faces difficult times ahead—but there is hope

   Right now, our nation is heading into a time of trial. We live in a
   deeply divided nation, where public discourse is broken and respect for
   different opinions has dwindled to nothing. Two opposing ideologies
   fight for the future of America.

   The outlook seems bleak, and the deck seems stacked against
   conservative principles. We have a White House and legislature bent on
   pushing a far-left agenda. They want to end the filibuster, pack the
   Supreme Court with their own judges, and advance their socialist
   policies unchecked. If they’re not stopped, we could see deeply
   disastrous policies like the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-All, and
   attacks on our freedom of speech become reality.

Enough is enough—it is time for renewal in America.

   As the far left threatens to take more control of our lives and
   livelihoods, The Heritage Foundation fights back with policy solutions
   that can make America that “shining city upon a hill” once again. And
   we are strategically positioned to do just that:
     * Heritage has a media distribution network second to none. Over 5
       million Americans visit our Daily Signal website each year, and
       nearly a million follow The Daily Signal on Facebook, bypassing the
       mainstream media filter to get the facts. Heritage experts appear
       on television and radio every week, publish hundreds of policy
       research reports annually, and host hundreds of meetings a year
       with grassroots leaders and local and national officials. We make
       sure that your conservative principles can be heard loud and clear.
     * Heritage stands strong for conservative principles no matter who’s
       in office, and we have for almost half a century. As Rush Limbaugh
       has said, “As long as there has been conservatism, there has been
       The Heritage Foundation. They have been a bulwark and they have
       they have stood strong and they have not wavered.”
     * Heritage’s over 100 policy experts are committed to solving complex
       policy issues with simple and effective conservative solutions, and
       making sure those recommendations are available for the
       conservative lawmakers who desperately need them right now.

Thank you for your gift to the Heritage Foundation!

   You know that sound conservative policy is the best answer to our
   nation’s problems.

   But the liberal left and the Washington Establishment have been blinded
   by fake news and a stubborn resolve to keep the status quo. This is
   unacceptable! They have to feel the heat—and that’s where Heritage
   Action for America comes in. Heritage Action’s lobbyists and grassroots
   activists put political pressure on legislators and lawmakers to get
   The Heritage Foundation’s policies across the finish line. Each and
   every day, Heritage Action is pressuring lawmakers to step it up and
   fix health care, stop amnesty, and pass welfare reform—or they’ll feel
   the heat at the polls. But we can’t do this without you.

Hold Washington’s feet to the fire with your gift to Heritage Action today!
