Illuminating BHL’s Dark Data: Citizen Scientists and AI Unlock Key
Biodiversity Data in GBIF

   Read the full blog post

   In the face of climate change and environmental challenges,
   understanding and documenting Earth’s biodiversity is essential. The
   Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) serves as a global
   repository for biodiversity data, playing a pivotal role in this
   critical mission of safeguarding our planet’s biodiversity. Species
   occurrence data sourced from the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL)
   provides insights into species distributions, behaviors, and
   interactions much deeper into time, offering key species baseline data
   required to effectively address the climate crisis. Without accurate
   and comprehensive data in GBIF, our collective ability to track
   environmental changes and make informed decisions is severely hampered.

   As a GBIF participant node, BHL is committed to sharing biodiversity
   data openly, adhering to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
   Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control,
   Responsibility, Ethics) data principles, and collaborating with a
   global network of biodiversity organizations to bolster and build
   capacity to strengthen the biodiversity information infrastructure. To
   honor our commitments, technical staff from BHL are working to
   establish a scalable data pipeline of occurrence data currently trapped
   in archival field notes, journals, letters, correspondence, and other
   primary source materials. The journey has been an arduous one due to
   poor OCR (optical character recognition) data quality for BHL’s
   sub-corpus of handwritten materials.

Flora, Fauna, and Photography: Five Years of Digitising Content for BHL in
Aotearoa

   Read the full blog post

   Auckland Museum joined the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL) in 2018
   and currently remains the only organisation in Aotearoa New Zealand
   contributing to the consortium. During my four years working as a
   technician and coordinator on the project, and with the help of a
   volunteer, Brianna Vincent, we have added over 25,000 pages, increasing
   our library of contributions from three to over 100 biodiversity
   literature items. These items span from 1790 to 2004, covering over 200
   years of biological knowledge, and range from field notebooks and
   sketches to identification guides, records and proceedings, educational
   textbooks, plant material, cyanotypes (blueprints), and hand-painted
   illustrations.

Interlinking BHL Data in the Wikimedia Project Ecosystem

   Read the full blog post

   The planet is at a critical juncture, where urgent action is required
   to combat climate change, biodiversity loss, and secure a sustainable
   future for our planet. With the release of the recent BHL Wikimedia
   white paper entitled Unifying Biodiversity Knowledge to Support Life on
   a Sustainable Planet, the Biodiversity Heritage Library Secretariat
   hopes that an expanded data vision for the BHL community presents new
   opportunities to take bold steps forward into Wikimedia projects and
   the emergent semantic web. The white paper sheds light on BHL’s crucial
   role as a member of the biodiversity informatics community and reveals
   a series of key use cases and big data challenges that, if addressed,
   could be opportunities to enhance global biodiversity data
   infrastructure.

2023 BHL Annual Meeting – Together Again in Paris

   Read the full blog post

   Originally scheduled for 2020, the BHL Annual Meeting finally made it
   to Paris after two years of virtual meetings and a break to hold the
   2022 BHL Annual Meeting in conjunction with the Society for the
   Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC) and the Natural
   Sciences Collections Society (NatSCA) meetings in Edinburgh, Scotland.

   The host for the 2023 meeting was the library of the Muséum national
   d’Histoire naturelle (MNHN), led by Alice Lemaire, Clément Oury, and
   Gildas Illien. The meeting took place 17-21 April 2023 and included BHL
   business meetings, tours of library and museum sites, and a BHL
   symposium titled “Fostering Data Driven Natural Science through Open
   Digital Libraries”. In total, the meeting gathered 38 attendees (both
   in-person and virtually) from 22 BHL partners from around the world.

Travelling Plants: A Collaborative Project

   Read the full blog post

   During 2020, the Archives team at Kew Gardens developed a collaboration
   with the University of Roehampton, the University of the Third Age
   (U3A), and the Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL), to create a model
   for the archive sector, which uses volunteer-driven, remote methods to
   transcribe and research collections, making them easily shareable and
   accessible using TEI-XML encoding. We wanted to create ways in which
   TEI could be embedded in the archive sector and managed by archivists
   with little experience of textual encoding, or time to carry out
   encoding themselves. In creating this model, we would also digitise,
   transcribe, encode, and make accessible in BHL one of Kew’s most
   important, but inaccessible volumes – the Kew Record Book. For Kew, it
   was important that the volume would be made fully accessible, as part
   of our commitment to transparency around our history and involvement in
   colonialism.

   The model we created was timely, as the COVID-19 pandemic meant many
   institutions could no longer accommodate volunteers on-site, and remote
   ways of working have persisted. The Travelling Plants project built a
   community and model of engaging with and developing the digital
   capacity of older people remotely, a sector of society that
   particularly felt the impact of social isolation during the pandemic.
