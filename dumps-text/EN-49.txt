   The English-speaking world has known numerous waves of immigration and
   its territory has been built through generations of people coming from
   different regions of the world. A legacy, an origin, roots are most of
   the time a subject of pride and of recognition. They claim their sense
   of belonging, they assert their cultural and ethnic origins.; This is
   patriotism, that is to say a love and a respect for their homeland.

Celebration of a legacy

   Many communities, many populations indeed celebrate their cultural
   heritage through literature, art, sports, traditions, food, even their
   daily routine and gestures: each difference, each particularity can be
   a proof of their singularity.
   For instance, Walter Scott, in his novels and poems, such as Rob Roy or
   Ivanhoe, enhances the national narrative. Through his characters, he
   pays tribute to his homeland, Scotland, using the great figures of the
   nation to put forward the pride of being a Scot, of having a Scottish
   lineage. This was shown in the movie Braveheart by Mel Gibson when he
   extols the merits of William Wallace who became the hero of the nation.
   The recognition of a Scottish spirit is also expressed in cultural
   movements like the Celtic Revival, a variety of movements and
   traditions in the 19^th and 20^th centuries that saw a renewed interest
   in aspects of Celtic culture. Artists and writers drew on the contents
   of Gaelic literature or Welsh-language literature. Traditions like the
   Highland Games can also be a proof of an assertion of a certain
   heritage: it aims at celebrating the Scottish culture through sport. It
   consists in watching bagpipes players parading, people wearing kilts,
   tug of war, toss the caber, etc.

A memorial heritage

   This legacy is also prominent through the construction for the
   preservation of a memorial heritage, passed on from one generation to
   another, a beacon of knowledge whose aim is to enlighten the world,
   with architecture, culture, art or nature The preservation of the great
   national parks in the USA like Yellowstone for example, are part of the
   heritage that needs to be kept intact in order to show to the future
   populations the grandeur of a nation and the beauty of a country; that
   is why the park rangers were created.
   Furthermore, in the United Kingdom, organizations like the National
   Trust still exist, and commemoration days like the Poppy Day are
   preserved. They are landmarks, or milestones in the History and the
   culture of a country. It is even more important for the immigrant
   communities as it helps them maintain a link with their homeland while
   enriching the culture of the country hosting them. This is what we can
   find in events like the Notting Hill Festival in London. It celebrates
   and illustrates multiculturalism in the UK. We can refer to Columbus
   Day in the US that is quite controversial because it only shows one
   aspect of the American culture while putting aside another, that of the
   natives and their longing to have their Indigenous Day. Through the
   celebration of their origins, we can frankly wonder if the idea of
   multiculturalism is at stake in the UK and in the USA.

Celebration as a fight

   Besides, this celebration can go beyond a simple claim and can rapidly
   become a fight, a struggle to defend a territory or a border or to
   preserve a threatened heritage or culture as is the case with Native
   populations or minorities. In fact, the Stolen Generation in Australia
   greatly harmed the Aborigine culture. White people had indeed
   orchestrated an organized abduction, consisting in taking the Aborigine
   children away from their families to place them in white institutions
   with the aim of assimilating and converting them to Christianize: it
   was a way to "whiten" them and to make this native population
   disappear. The same happened with other native populations, such as the
   Maoris in New Zealand, the Native Americans in the USA, the Inuit in
   Greenland and in Canada, for whom the respect of their cultural and
   environmental heritage is a question of survival.
   Closer to us, the fight between Northern Ireland and The Republic of
   Ireland concerning their border and their territories is quite
   symptomatic of this notion of cultural anchoring. The period of the
   Troubles has indeed marked the landscape and the spirits of many Irish
   men and women since each one of them had a member of their family
   touched, wounded or even killed during this conflict for the
   reunification of the two Irelands. Songs like Bloody Sunday by U2 or
   Zombie by the Cranberries or even Nothing compares by Sinead O'Connor
   are examples of the mounting tension between the protestants and the
   Catholics, a tension that is still perceptible nowadays. It has become
   a matter of pride and territory and neither side wants to retreat since
   it would mean the end of their dreams and the end of their identity.
   The identification of a territory is essential for many artists or
   writers who spend much of their time and career representing their
   homeland, their mother country, whether to praise it through odes and
   eulogies or to give a nostalgic if not critical vision. For instance,
   Willa Cather in My Antonia relates the toughness and the determination
   of pioneers and the nostalgia linked to this past. It is the story of a
   young orphan, Jim Burden (Burden like having a weight on his shoulders)
   who goes to live in the great plains of Nebraska with his grandparents.
   Once there, he meets the elder daughter of a Czech family, Antonia and
   the novel follows the life of these two characters while describing the
   way America was built by the first immigrants and pioneers.

Withdrawing into ourselves?

   Actually, claiming a part of the territory and asserting our cultural
   origin can lead to some polemics, and can make people stray from their
   mainstream path. It can even lead to xenophobia or to people
   withdrawing into their shells. We can for instance allude to the
   confederate legacy in the southern states of the USA, a legacy that is
   symbolized by what happened in Charlottesville a couple of years ago.
   Afro- Americans and Civil Rights activists wanted to remove the statue
   of General Lee, the hero of the Confederacy during the Civil War. This
   figure was indeed controversial because it still symbolizes a period
   when slavery was tolerated and accepted in the southern states;
   therefore, it still reinforces the idea of a rampant racism. White
   supremacists refused to remove the statue and it ended with a
   confrontation between the KKK and the black activists that resulted in
   the killing of a young lawyer who was run over by a racist lunatic.
   We can also quote all the events that are linked to the Brexit which
   was a way for the conservatives and the Ukip (the far-right movement
   led by Nigel Farage in the UK) to preserve their insularity, their
   singularity and above all their identity and national sovereignty.
