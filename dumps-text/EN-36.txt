Cultural Heritage Informatics

You are here

     * Kent
     * School of Information
     * Cultural Heritage Informatics

   Cultural heritage informatics (CHI) is an emerging field of
   interdisciplinary research and practice concerned with the role of
   information and computing technologies (ICTs) to support the creation,
   capture, organization, and pluralization of culture, in whatever form,
   as heritage.

   Cultural heritage stewardship encompasses numerous allied disciplines
   including archival studies, librarianship, preservation of heritage
   materials, and museum studies. They share a common goal of the
   protection of cultural heritage in all forms, both tangible and
   intangible.

   While there is a focus on existing data, datasets, and metadata and
   ways to link them, CHI also necessarily includes identification and
   exploration into appraisal, data capture, preservation, data
   processing, curation, forensics and reconstruction, visualization,
   documentation, access and discoverability, as well as development of
   innovative technologies to empower and support engagement with ICTs as
   tools for communication and remembering of culture.

Pathways

   Archival Studies | Museum Studies | Special Collections

Archival Studies

   Archivists are information professionals who assess, collect, organize,
   preserve, maintain control over, and provide access to records and
   archives determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by
   an archivist can consist of a variety of analog and digital forms and
   documentary genres, including letters, diaries, logs, various other
   writings, official documents, photographs and other visual materials,
   sound recordings, and moving images. According to archival scholar
   Laura Millar, “these records are kept because they have continuing
   value to the creating agency and to other potential users. They are the
   documentary evidence of past events. They are the facts we use to
   interpret and understand history.” Archival material can be found in
   many institutions and organizations, as well as in personal
   collections, thus archivists work in a wide variety of environments.

   For further information on this area, please consult the advising sheet
   for the Archival Studies pathway.

Museum Studies

   There is no agreed-upon single word to describe all museum workers. For
   lack of that word, here we use museum professional. But this field-wide
   disagreement perhaps arises because there is not one profession, but
   several museal professions that consist of a range of activities
   undertaken in a museum (e.g., collections work, administration, visitor
   services, exhibit design). In this program, we approach the education
   of museum professionals in a holistic way, from a museological
   perspective, that provides education in the whole range of activities,
   skills, and theory about/in museums. This is done in the broader
   context of information science, rather than from a specific content
   area; that is, the framework is from LIS but specific knowledge and
   skills are museum-focused. Students are taught within a broader
   context, one that understands that LIS is about the interaction of
   people and information and this foundation cuts across all types of
   information institutions and information work. The intent of this
   specialization is to embed and integrate the thinking and training
   across information institutions such as libraries, museums, and
   archives. For this reason, there are many pathways a student can take
   that includes museum studies.

   For further information on this area, please consult the advising sheet
   for the Museum Studies pathway.

Special Collections

   In library science, special collections are libraries or library units
   that house materials requiring specialized security and user services.
   Special collections can also be found in archival and museum
   environments, although they may not be described as such. Materials
   housed in special collections can be in any format (including rare
   books, manuscripts, photographs, archives, ephemera, and digital
   records), and are generally characterized by their artifactual or
   monetary value, physical format, uniqueness or rarity, and/or an
   institutional commitment to long-term preservation and access. They can
   also include association with important figures or institutions in
   history, culture, politics, sciences, or the arts. Individual
   libraries, archival institutions, and other cultural heritage
   organizations determine for themselves what materials constitute their
   own special collections.

   For further information on this area, please consult the advising sheet
   for the Special Collections pathway.
