The Finnish Genetic Disease Heritage

   Molecular genetics research on a group of rare genetic diseases called
   the Finnish Disease Heritage has been a key focus of The Folkhälsan
   Research Center for decades. A new review article published in Disease
   Models and Mechanisms gives a fresh update on this interesting and
   evolving group of diseases.

     It is important to continue studies with rare diseases, which often
     help advancing understanding of more common disorders with similar
     symptomatic repertoire.

   Hereditary monogenic disorders are caused by single, usually
   autosomal-recessive gene variants and can be completely sporadic or
   enriched in historically isolated populations due to past genetic drift
   events. In Finland, distinct subpopulations have remained and
   maintained their unique genetic repertoire, partially due to relative
   geographic isolation and several evolutionary bottlenecks leading to
   social isolation on a population level. The Finnish disease heritage is
   a prominent example of this phenomena. In Finland about one in five
   persons carries a gene variant associated with at least one Finnish
   heritage disease, and about one in 500 children born is affected.
   This is partially due to the prominence of what is called population
   isolates. Population isolates are defined as subpopulations originally
   derived from a small group of individuals who became isolated because
   of a certain founding event, e.g. settlement of a new territory, and
   have remained isolated for several generations. This is called the
   founder effect, and is an example of a bottleneck phenomenon in which,
   for one reason or another, only a few survivors of a population remain
   to repopulate. Other typical evolutionary bottlenecks are famine,
   epidemics and war. Finland’s population history is a great example of
   this, being characterized by the founder effect, several bottlenecks,
   isolation and the subsequent genetic drift.

Pioneering research

   In the early 1960’s, Dr Reijo Norio conducted genealogical studies on
   congenital nephrosis, an inherited disorder characterized by protein in
   the urine and swelling of the body, often resulting in infection and
   kidney failure. He discovered the autosomal-recessive mode of
   inheritance of this disease. An autosomal-recessive genetic condition
   must be passed down from both parents in order to manifest, become
   phenotype. In contrast, autosomal-dominant inheritance only requires
   getting the gene defect from one parent. In the wake of this discovery,
   Dr. Norio later described how the founder effect and isolation had
   nudged the Finnish gene pool towards both having over- and under
   representation of distinct genetic diseases.

   Enter the Finnish disease heritage, the FDH. An FDH disease is a
   genetic disease or disorder that is significantly more common among the
   Finnish than other populations. Finnish physicians were often the first
   to identify and describe many of these diseases, however, their foreign
   colleagues have later identified some of the diseases in other
   population isolates as well.

   "The Perheentupa-steps" (Uusimaa et al. 2022). This widely used
   traditional representation of the Finnish disease heritage (FDH)
   diseases organizes them chronologically based on the year in which the
   disease description was published. The respective Online Mendelian
   Inheritance in Man (OMIM) codes are in parentheses. FDH diseases are in
   black and candidate diseases in blue.

   As research has progressed, geneticists can now relatively easily
   pinpoint whether a new FDH candidate disease has a founder mutation and
   whether the allele frequency clearly differs between Finnish and other
   populations in the world. Today, the FDH contains 39 diseases in total.
   34 of them autosomal-recessive, three autosomal-dominant, and two
   X-linked (meaning that the genes are only found on X-chromosomes). The
   Folkhälsan Research Center (FHRC) has contributed to around half of
   these findings.

To Develop Treatments We Must Understand The Pathomechanisms

   The FDH has opened the door for genotype-phenotype discoveries,
   pioneering genetic research and, more recently, to research into the
   underlying molecular mechanisms and potential treatments. But the FDH
   itself is evolving, too. In the new review article, published in
   Disease Models and Mechanisms, a group of expert authors including Dr.
   Jukka Kallijärvi working on GRACILE-syndrome at the FHRC, give a fresh
   update on the FDH.

   – Prof. emerita Vineta Fellman’s decades-long and my more recent work
   on GRACILE syndrome is an example of a successful trajectory from
   clinical work via genetics to experimental research aiming at
   understanding the molecular disease mechanism and developing
   treatments, says Jukka Kallijärvi.

   Docent Jukka Kallijärvi is studying the GRACILE-syndrome at the FHRC.

   Science evolves progressively and research seldom yields immediate
   results, but the hopes are high, and the effort is deemed to be worth
   it in the long run.

   – For many of the FDH diseases the experimental work is still awaiting
   to be started. It is a demanding and expensive endeavor and not all
   diseases can be easily studied in experimental models such as cell
   cultures or mice, but this should not discourage us from doing it,
   Kallijärvi notes.

Better Understanding Of More Common Disorders

   Even though the benefits of studying rare diseases might seem marginal,
   advancing the frontier within genetic science has a habit of giving new
   insights and deepening understanding of human genetics in general. As
   such, results tend to end up benefiting medicine as a whole.

   – It is important to continue studies with rare diseases, which often
   help advancing understanding of more common disorders with similar
   symptomatic repertoire. Utilization of modern methodology in
   experiments tackling the FDH provides missing information of the
   physiological functions that the disease-causing genes carry out under
   physiological conditions. For this, we are creating new in vivo models
   with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate preclinical models that
   enable novel treatment discoveries for these devastating diseases, adds
   Dr. Satu Kuure, one of the corresponding authors of the review.

   The researchers underline that maintaining the ongoing research to
   identify novel disease-causing variations and comprehend their
   molecular and cellular pathomechanisms is crucial. These combined
   efforts will make it easier to diagnose uncommon diseases and lay the
   foundation for a better knowledge of more common diseases in the
   future.
