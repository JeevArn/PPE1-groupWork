Have you seen the phrase “Culture in Crisis"?

   In recent years, particularly since the rise of ISIS’ destructive
   activities in the Middle East, it’s become common to see articles in
   the news media as well as in academic journals on the theme of
   “cultural heritage in crisis.” You could say it’s a booming field.
   But how true is it?
   It’s certainly true that cultural heritage is in danger of destruction,
   looting, or illicit trafficking in many places around the world. It’s
   also true that new types of threats to cultural heritage have developed
   in the last few decades.
   They include,
     * the easier movement of goods across national borders via online
       marketplaces like eBay
     * the spread of global banking
     * the outbreak of war and other forms of political instability and
       poverty
     * the widespread availability of heavy machinery and explosives

   Some regions—most recently the heritage-rich areas of the Middle
   East—have certainly experienced a marked increase in illicit
   trafficking in the context of ongoing political upheavals and
   conflicts.
   But usage of the term “crisis” to describe the destruction of cultural
   heritage around the world is perhaps a misleading one. “Crisis” is a
   term that indicates a problem that has an urgent, yet temporary
   quality. However, the loss and destruction of cultural heritage is not
   new in human history and is not restricted by the duration of political
   instability in faraway lands. Many regions of the world, including the
   United States, face a longstanding and ongoing struggle to protect
   heritage in the face of numerous challenges, regardless of political,
   social, or economic security. It may be worth considering that the idea
   of “crisis” deceptively frames the destruction of heritage as a product
   of temporary instabilities that cease to be a problem once conflicts
   are over. In reality, conditions of “crisis” only really provide new
   opportunities for heritage destruction processes that were already
   happening and will continue happening after the “crisis” is over.

Threats to cultural heritage: war

   Let’s take a closer look at these processes. Broadly speaking, there
   are two types of threats:
     * destruction of heritage sites and objects caused by war, poverty,
       and development initiatives
     * the looting and trafficking of objects that frequently arises out
       of those contexts

   In wartime, destruction of heritage sites can be a result of collateral
   damage, for example, when a bomb targeting one location inadvertently
   hits another; or it can be the result of intentional damage, aimed to
   demoralize and insult the values and religious and cultural symbols of
   an enemy. It is often difficult to distinguish between collateral and
   intentional damage, and perpetrators may claim deliberate destruction
   was an accident in an attempt to avoid prosecution. In the Syria
   conflict, for example, you’ve probably heard about the destruction
   caused by ISIS. However, the majority of damage to cities and to
   heritage has in fact not been caused by ISIS, but by the Syrian
   government’s campaign of relentless aerial bombardment, which has
   destroyed up to 70% of the fabric of the ancient city of Aleppo, a
   UNESCO World Heritage site.

   And though it’s easy to demonize a regime in a country far away, it’s
   important to remember that similar levels of destruction were caused by
   both the Axis powers and the Allies in World War II — for the Allies,
   most famously in Dresden, where a British and American aerial campaign
   in 1945 left more than 70% of the city in ruins. The neglect of the
   occupying U.S. forces in Iraq in 2003 famously led to the looting of
   the National Museum of Iraq, with thousands of objects lost, only half
   of which have returned, as well as the burning and destruction of
   Iraq’s magnificent national library, including hundreds of priceless
   manuscripts dating back to the 16th century. Deliberate or neglectful
   destruction of heritage has long been a key strategy of war, and
   perpetrators are rarely prosecuted for it.
   The long history of the destruction of heritage shows us that the
   elimination of culture has always been viewed as a powerful tool of
   domination and as a key strategy for eliminating the value humans
   accord to their lives. In recent years, the destruction of heritage —
   whether through war, commercial exploitation, and/or looting — has been
   defined by UNESCO as a form of cultural cleansing. In taking human
   lives, oppressors erase the existence of individual people: but in
   destroying culture, the memory and identity of entire peoples are
   erased. It is not surprising to note, therefore, that the destruction
   of heritage is often a precursor to genocide. This is because in
   denying people their past, perpetrators also deny them a future.

Threats to cultural heritage: development, climate change, tourism, and
natural disasters

   Nevertheless, wartime destruction of heritage is only a small fraction
   of the overall loss of cultural heritage around the world. Much more
   significant and long-lasting is destruction due to urban development,
   mineral and resource extraction, climate change, tourism, and even
   natural disasters. For example, the ancient Buddhist site of Mes Aynak
   in Afghanistan is now threatened by Chinese mining interests, a
   situation made famous in a recent documentary. Similarly, the push to
   expand resource extraction on public lands in the United States is also
   causing widespread loss of heritage, as at the Bears Ears National
   Monument, which was controversially reduced by 85% in a decision signed
   by President Trump in December 2017.

   Although many heritage sites are preserved in order to encourage
   tourist revenue, tourism can also cause massive destruction because of
   the large numbers of people it can attract and also because
   transforming a site into a tourist-friendly locale often profoundly
   transforms its meaning for local people, who may find their connections
   to a place have been erased. Such is the case at Dubrovnik, a city that
   was reconstructed by an international consortium of donors after the
   Balkan war and which now finds itself managing a Game of
   Thrones-inspired tourist influx that threatens to leave little of the
   original city behind, a destruction that some residents have
   characterized as worse than that during wartime.

Looting

   If destruction of heritage during wartime is akin to a relatively
   sudden death, looting is like a cancer that slowly erodes it. Looting
   is the theft of heritage items for sale on the antiquities market, most
   often to wealthy private buyers in the United States and Europe. As art
   history professor Nathan Elkins has shown, the consequences of
   purchasing even small items like coins can be devastating for our
   knowledge about the past. Once an object is removed from its original
   environment, it instantly loses much of its ability to convey
   information about how people once lived.

   Archaeologists call the environment in which an object is found, its
   context. Context is the object and its relationship to all the other
   objects and material in an archaeological site. The relationships
   between these objects is what enables archaeologists to recreate the
   past (objects that have been looted, and thereby robbed of this context
   can be called “ungrounded“). As such, even the smallest objects, such
   as ancient coins, can provide powerful evidence about the lives of
   people in the past. While locals are often blamed for looting, it is
   important to point out that local looting is often subsistence looting
   — looting carried out to supplement meagre incomes — and that it is
   only profitable because it responds to demand in wealthy countries. The
   antiquities market is vast, and as the Wall Street Journal reported
   last year, it has consequences far beyond just loss of our knowledge
   about the past, since much like drug trafficking, its profits fuel
   terrorism, criminal enterprises, and many other forms of criminal
   activity.

What can be done?

   In repositioning the discussion of the “current crisis” to a discussion
   of how we are in fact currently experiencing the latest iteration of a
   long-standing problem with global reach, we can avoid simplistic
   solutions that propose that squashing the “bad guys” — for example,
   ISIS — will solve the destruction and looting problem once and for all.
   Most importantly, it allows us to focus on the real driver of
   destruction: the demand in wealthy countries for heritage objects — a
   demand that ultimately fuels the entire antiquities trade — and the lax
   legislation that enables that trade to flourish. It also permits a
   conversation about related issues, for example the lack of public
   education about the antiquities trade, or problematic distinctions such
   as that between art — largely considered to be a private commodity
   subject to market demand, versus heritage — which is typically framed
   as “universal” and the patrimony of all.
   Understanding that cultural heritage has been under threat for a very
   long time allows us to avoid short-term, crisis-based responses, and
   enables us to craft long-lasting, systemic solutions.

       Would the outbreak of war be a new type of threat, per se? War has
       been around from Adam, and it has always involved destruction of
       history, has it not?

            War has certainly always been a threat. But wars fought with
            bows and arrows are less destructive of artifacts and cultures
            than wars fought with high explosive devices and thermonuclear
            devices.

            I agree that it repeats itself. I've no idea whether that was
            purposeful. Maybe it was just poor writing. My suggestion was
            that you, who identified it a poor writing, take a chance on
            improving it, and then seeing if that improvement might not be
            recognized by the guy in charge of the course.

       Hi.the statement regarding destroying the culture, memory and
       identity of entire peoples is so true and in a society like we have
       in South Africa, is one of the dividing factors in our society. We
       have university students who take a statue down in front of a
       university because he symbolizes white supremacy. I am talking
       about the 'Rhodes' memorial , a lifesize statue of Cecil John
       Rhodes, who most certainly was not a saint but he had dreams for
       southern Africa that have in part still to be built. He was
       involved in the Gold and diamond trade, which no doubt exploited
       the labour force, but it did bring a prosperity to the land. He was
       the founder of the university of Cape town to which the students in
       question were hopefully being educated. The names of Towns and
       cities, not to mention the roads are all being changed by the
       incumbent government that just causes dismay as the people to which
       the names are being changed have no place in a democratic country.
       so, the destruction of heritage is certainly causing a psycological
       genocide where one fears any discussion.

       Does that mean that is like a war for keeping art and sculptures
       safe and secure?
       Just curious,
       Thanks!

       , but in this quest to save cultural heritage, aren't we fighting a
       losing battle? As long as people, who are the basis of everything,
       won't recognize the value of heritage either cultural or of any
       other kind, there would be no point trying to save it.
       Even during all sorts of conflicts, everyday, every hour we lose
       something valuable. I recognize the importance in trying to save
       it, but what about the situations beyond our control? For example,
       we can't force the govt. of America to cease it's military
       operations. We can't compromise with international security to stop
       this destruction at any cost. What can we do about that?

       What is ISIS? Some sort of organization? The article didn't explain
       who they were or what it was?
       Also, does this "Art History" Course only talk about the looting
       and breakage of artifacts?

            ISIS is a convenient acronym for "Islamic State in Syria". The
            same movement was elsewhere known as ISIL and, internally, as
            Daish. It is mentioned here because it was a "current thing"
            when the lesson was made a few years ago.
            Because artifacts are often artistic expressions, discussion
            of them is right and proper in a course on Art History.
            You are at the entry point of this course. Why not skip ahead
            to the more chronological parts of the course (there are 16
            different topics), or to one of the particular areas or eras
            that might interest you more. When you finish those, you might
            also return to Special Topics or ARCHES, because the
            instruction is valuable all the way through.
