   Happy #EuropeDay! Europe Day held on 9 May every y Happy #EuropeDay!
   Europe Day held on 9 May every year celebrates peace and unity in
   Europe. The date marks the anniversary of the historic 'Schuman
   declaration' that set out his idea for a new form of political
   cooperation in Europe, which would make war between Europe's nations
   unthinkable. Schuman's proposal is considered to be the beginning of
   what is now the #EuropeanUnion. #heritage #culturalheritagemanagement

   May Day! This historic holiday dates back to ancie May Day! This
   historic holiday dates back to ancient times and was traditionally used
   to celebrate springtime and new life. Traditions often include
