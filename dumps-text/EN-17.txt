   Hi everybody,
   I am interested in a career in art law and cultural property. Any
   suggestions? I've heard at LSE there is a course in cultural property
   and heritage law, unfortunately the deadline for the llm is now closed,
   but the same course is also available with the MSc in Law, Anthropology
   adn Society. What about QMUL?
   It's something very different, but I've heard there are also PhD and
   Research Masters programmes at the university of Glasgow (The
   Trafficking Culture project).
   What are your suggestions on this subject?
