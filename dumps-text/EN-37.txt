   Information and communication technologies (ICT) are revolutionizing
   the ways in which the public interacts, understands, and appreciates
   the importance of cultural heritage around the world. They are
   additionally enabling sustainable tourism to flourish in an era of
   unprecedented globalization. In this interview, James Blake Wiener of
   Ancient History Encyclopedia speaks to Professor Lorenzo Cantoni - the
   chair holder of the UNESCO Chair in ICT at the Universit√† della
   Svizzera italiana to develop and promote sustainable tourism in World
   Heritage Sites - about the ways in which ICT is altering how we see the
   past and travel around the world.

   JBW: Professor Cantoni, I bid you a warm welcome to Ancient History
   Encyclopedia (AHE). Please tell us more about UNESCO's ICT Chair at USI
   ‚Äì Universit√† della Svizzera italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. When was
   it established and what are its general aims? How did you become
   involved in the Chair's genesis?

   LC: I am really happy we can have this conversation!

   The UNESCO Chair in ICT to develop and promote sustainable tourism in
   World Heritage Sites has been established at USI in 2013. But the
   process started earlier, with the preparation of the application
   dossier, its evaluation and approval by UNESCO, up to the agreement
   between UNESCO and USI university. I have been involved since the very
   beginning, together with several young colleagues and with the
   assistance of the Swiss Commission for UNESCO. We believed that the
   extensive experience we got throughout the years doing research and
   development in three related areas ‚Äì eTourism, eLearning, and ICT4D
   (ICT for Sustainable Development) ‚Äì could be of interest for UNESCO
   enlisted World Heritage Sites. Hence the proposed Chair, whose goals
   are to conduct extensive research and development activities in the
   field, as well as to do training and to promote knowledge sharing among
   relevant stakeholders.

   JBW: What are the specific programs and initiatives that the ICT Chair
   is currently overseeing? Could you also share with our audience some
   further details about the 2018 Summer School of the UNESCO chair in
   ICT, which will be held at the University of Turku, in Finland?

   LC: At the UNESCO Chair in USI we do research and development
   activities, involving Master and PhD students from USI, as well as
   several visiting scholars who join us from all over the world.

   Several educational and training activities are also organized: regular
   courses at USI's Master in International Tourism and a Summer School
   organized every year in a different place. In 2018 we have partnered
   with the University of Turku, in Finland, to run a very innovative
   travelling Summer School: we will visit five World Heritage Sites and
   two UNESCO Biosphere Reserves in the southern part of Finland,
   co-creating with local stakeholders technical solutions in line with
   our mission: to orchestrate ICT in order to support and promote
   sustainable tourism in World Heritage Sites (we are still accepting
   late applications and it is possible also to participate online).

   Besides face to face training activities, we are leveraging on ICT to
   offer online training. In particular, we have launched the first ever
   MOOC ‚Äì Massive Open Online Course ‚Äì titled ‚ÄúeTourism: Communication
   Perspectives‚Äù (with more than 8,000 learners), and recently, as part of
   the activities of the UNESCO-UNITWIN Network ‚ÄúCulture, Tourism, and
   Development‚Äù, led by Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne University, the MOOC
   ‚ÄúTourism Management of UNESCO World Heritage Sites‚Äù. This MOOC will
   remain open until the end of 2018 and has attracted so far about 5,000
   learners from 159 countries.

   JBW: What is ‚Äúsustainable tourism‚Äù and how can it improve the public's
   awareness and understanding of cultural heritage, Professor Cantoni?

   LC: The term ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù suggests that something should be kept
   available not only for our generation but also for the future ones ‚Äì
   this is the very meaning of its French equivalent: ‚Äúdurable‚Äù ‚Äì
   something that lasts.

   If we think of Tourism and Heritage, we can refer to three areas of
   sustainability: environmental, economic, and socio-cultural.

   Environmental/ecological sustainability refers to the fact that
   tourists should not damage the natural resources. They should avoid
   behaviors that create excessive pollution or irreversible damage to the
   biodiversity. In some critical areas, in order not to exceed the
   carrying capacity of a place, quotas might be applied.
   Tourists should not damage the natural resources. They should avoid
   behaviors that create excessive pollution or irreversible damage to the
   biodiversity.

   Economic sustainability refers to the fact that tourism players, and in
   general the local populations, should be able to make a reasonable
   profit out of the tourism-related activities. In general, we know that
   most of the tourism/hospitality enterprises are micro, small, and
   medium ones, frequently small family businesses. They are very
   resilient and tend to look after the place and its correct management
   also for the future generations. Companies focused only on making huge
   profits might be less sustainable and might start and end activities
   only based on short-term fluctuations, or be less interested in sharing
   the profits with workers and the community at large. For instance, a
   company might build and operate a hotel, and then leave the building
   empty as soon as the business becomes not profitable, or less
   profitable than in other places.

   Socio-cultural sustainability refers to the fact that tourism is, by
   nature, based on hosting people from outside a community ‚Äì be they from
   the same country (domestic tourism), or from other countries
   (international tourism). It is very important that visitors do not
   damage the quality of life of locals, nor their lifestyles and peculiar
   traditions. We have studied, for instance, the case of Lalibela, a
   World Heritage Site in Ethiopia. It consists of eleven medieval
   monolithic cave churches of the 13th century CE, still actively used as
   places of worship by Christian Copts. Tourists cannot, and should not
   disturb or disrupt the life of the monks and of the local communities
   living there and looking after such property. In fact, what we look for
   in cultural tourism ‚Äì and in tourism in general ‚Äì is authentic
   experiences: if tourism destroys or deeply alters life at a
   destination, what remains is a kind of ‚Äúfake copy‚Äù, something we
   usually refer to as ‚ÄúDisneyfication‚Äù.

   Analogous situations can be found in places experiencing the so-called
   ‚Äúovertourism‚Äù. Their tourists do not bring the usual economic and
   social benefits any longer; on the contrary, they put the very quality
   of locals' life at risk.

   JBW: In your own words, how do media, technology, tourism, and cultural
   heritage intersect? Which technologies do you believe will play a
   commanding role in safeguarding cultural heritage and promoting
   sustainable tourism in the future?

   LC: In the UNESCO Chair in Lugano we have proposed the ‚ÄúABCDE‚Äù
   framework, which refers to five main areas of relevance: Access,
   Better, Connect, Dis-intermediate, and Educate.
     * Access: ICT can offer endless opportunities to provide good quality
       information about heritage sites, through websites, videos, social
       media, mobile apps, and the like. Definitely, AHE is a major player
       in this area, providing extensive information about so many places
       and their historical relevance.
     * Better: once the travelers reach the destination, they can make the
       best of it thanks to mobile apps (so-called Location Based
       Services), augmented reality, gamification applications, etc. For
       instance, when it comes to archeological sites, augmented reality
       can help the visitor to better understand how the place might have
       looked like. But it can also be used to recognize trees and animals
       or to better interpret paintings in a museum, just to mention some
       other applications. Angkor Wat, Cambodia

     * Connect: ICT can help to connect the three main players in this
       relationship: locals, visitors, and the heritage itself. For
       instance, we assisted RETOSA, the Regional Tourism Organisation of
       Southern Africa, developing an offline/online digital game to help
       the young generations to know more about the World Heritage Sites
       of the 15 countries of the Southern African Development Community
       (SADC) and to reflect on how sustainable tourism might be a major
       component of local development. Nowadays such a tool has become an
       app everyone can use. In fact, for the first time ever, the United
       Nations named 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism
       for Development. We should think of ICT not only as tools to spread
       voices, to speak aloud, but also ‚Äì I would say: first of all ‚Äì as
       tools to listen to what travelers are sharing about their
       experience at a destination. ICT enables us to have much deeper
       insights into travelers' experiences, expectations, satisfaction
       (or not). We are then in a better position to improve or redesign
       touristic offers.
     * Dis-intermediate: as I mentioned above, in order to be sustainable,
       tourism should bring a reasonable profit to the local communities.
       In some regions of the Global South, there is a risk that
       international visitors pay most of their travel money to travel
       operators located outside of the destination country. Thanks to
       ICT, some relationships between prospect travelers and players at
       the destination can be dis-intermediated so that the destination
       itself benefits from most of the money spent. For instance, we
       partnered with local players in the Island of Mozambique ‚Äì a World
       Heritage Site ‚Äì to develop their online presence: a super simple
       website listing local B&Bs and their telephone numbers. After a few
       years, more than 60% of the bookings to such B&Bs are done directly
       and not through external tour operators/travel agents. Island of
       Mozambique
       Island of Mozambique
       Stig Nygaard (CC BY)
     * Educate: ICT can also be used to help tourism players to learn and
       upskill, especially in such a fast-moving context. In fact, due to
       the very nature of hospitality and tourism, many operators cannot
       afford to attend regular courses, hence the need for more flexible
       learning offers. Here, free online courses like the MOOC I already
       mentioned above can make the difference.

   this short 90-seconds animation video.

   JBW: Could you share further information about the #faces4heritage
   campaign? How and when was this initiative started, and what are its
   aims? I believe that the #faces4heritage campaign has been active for
   several years if I am not mistaken.

   LC: Right, happy to share something about this initiative. In 2015,
   UNESCO launched the global #Unite4Heritage campaign, aimed at raising
   awareness about the destruction of heritage done by violent extremists,
   e.g. in Syria and Iraq, but also in Lybia, Mali, and elsewhere. At the
   chair, we wanted to support such a campaign and developed
   #faces4heritage, an online tool that enables you to combine half of
   your face with half of the face of a destroyed statue. The created
   image can then be used as your profile picture on social media so that
   your friends/followers are invited to reflect on such a dramatic issue.
   #faces4heritage has been and is still very active on Twitter, being
   among the most used hashtags in combination with #Unite4Heritage.

   JBW: Professor Cantoni, how can the average citizen become more
   involved in the processes of preservation and valorization with regard
   to cultural heritage? Do you have any specific recommendations or
   personal suggestions?

   LC: Just a couple of recommendations and a further reflection. First of
   all, I would definitely recommend to prepare yourself before the trip;
   AHE and other resources will definitely help. Additionally, try to have
   meaningful interactions with local people and to buy/use local products
   as much as possible. In general, invest more in quality than in
   quantity: visiting a place should not be just aimed at adding it to our
   ‚Äúvisited list‚Äù but to deeply understand its nature, history, and
   culture.

   Readers of AHE might find it useful to reflect on the very origin of
   the word 'culture', which comes from the ancient Latin Language. Its
   root is the verb 'colo', meaning 'look after', 'care'. It had three
   main areas of application.

   The first one is looking after our natural environment: 'agriculture'
   (which means cultivating the fields). While visiting a place we should
   pay attention to the way locals interact with their environment,
   including their local ingredients and cuisine.

   The second one is cultivating ourselves as human beings: what we
   usually refer to as 'culture'. Think of the way we inhabit places from
   architecture and urban planning to the way we dress and behave, the
   schooling systems, all visual and performative arts, socio-political
   systems, and so on. By the way, thinking of Latin again, 'habitus'
   coming from the verb 'habeo' (to have) is closely connected with living
   places ('habitare': living), fashion and costumes ('habitus': garment),
   as well as ways of living ('habitus': habit).

   The third area is the way we cultivate our relationship with God:
   'cult', religion.

   All of those dimensions should be considered by a responsible and
   sustainable traveler. A well-traveled person, I would say.

   JBW: Professor Cantoni, I thank you so much for your time and
   consideration. I can speak on behalf of all my colleagues at AHE and
   say that we are looking forward to cementing a proactive and vigorous
   relationship with you and everyone associated with UNESCO's ICT Chair
   at the Universit√† della Svizzera italiana.

   LC: I am also very much looking forward to a fruitful collaboration
   with AHE and its community!

   Ancient History Encyclopedia is delighted to announce that the
   publication of this interview coincides with the formation of a new
   partnership with the UNESCO Chair in ICT at the Universit√† della
   Svizzera italiana to develop and promote sustainable tourism in World
   Heritage Sites.
