   We strive towards a Europe where the diversity of cultures, the arts,
   and cultural heritage are essential to the development of a genuine
   openness of mind and basic rights, and where open and interactive
   processes and practices of culture that combine to help us deal with
   the complexities of living with ourselves and one another.
