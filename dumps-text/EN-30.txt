About

   Membership & current member organizations

   Welcome to the Forum on Information Standards in Heritage (FISH). This
   site presents the work of the forum and contains links to recommended
   information resources that support best practice in recording cultural
   heritage.

   We hope the site will give you an overview of the different
   documentation guidance and indexing tools available and used by our
   members. Please help us keep the website current and update us on
   any additional or future resources, initiatives and conferences.

   The forum is guided by the FAIR principles for data management and
   stewardship. This seeks to make data Findable, Accessible,
   Interoperable and Reusable. For more information on the FAIR
   principles, please visit their website:

   Forum meetings are held twice a year, to discuss strategic and
   technical issues and developments. The meetings combine the efforts of
   both FISH and HEIRNET (Historic Environment Information Resources
   Network), two organisations with similar interests and aims.

   A smaller Terminology Working Group also meets regularly, to discuss
   vocabulary issues and candidate terms for the collection of thesauri
   and authority files produced by or on behalf of FISH.

   FISH was established in 1998 as a non for profit organization. We are a
   formally convened group with terms of reference and a national profile.
   FISH is not a legal entity and we have no employed staff, income or
   budget. There are currently over 400 members.
