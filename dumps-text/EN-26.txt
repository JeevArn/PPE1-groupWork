CBP memo orders agents not to misgender 'members of the public'

Reporter spars with State Department official on why they added 'mandatory'
pronouns to emails

   AP’s State Department reporter Matt Lee grilled deputy spokesperson
   Vedant Patel on the change after Thursday's briefing.

   An internal U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) memo obtained by
   the Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project and shared with Fox News
   Digital prohibits agents from using "he, him, she, her" pronouns when
   initially interacting with members of the public.

   "DO NOT use 'he, him, she, her' pronouns until you have more
   information about, or provided by, the individual," reads the memo
   obtained by Heritage via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

   Oversight Project Director Mike Howell told Fox News Digital in an
   interview Tuesday that the "members of the public" who border patrol
   agents most often interact with are illegal migrants.

   "Border Patrol deals with more illegal aliens than any entity in the
   federal government. This forced language guidance is designed to coddle
   illegal aliens," Howell said.

   "I guess it wasn’t enough for the Biden administration to betray the
   Border Patrol by purposefully unleashing chaos on the southern border,"
   Howell said. "Now, the radical political leadership is enrolling agents
   in a forced-speech program to call illegal aliens by their preferred
   pronouns."

   CBP did not respond to Fox News Digital's multiple requests for
   comment.

   The memo encourages agents to use "a universal greeting, such as 'Good
   Morning' or ‘Good Evening’ in the initial greeting."

   "If an incorrect pronoun is used and corrected by the individual,
   acknowledge the oversight and use the correct pronoun," the memo reads.

   It also lists "key terms" with definitions next to each: bisexual, gay,
   gender expression, gender identity, gender non-conforming, intersex,
   lesbian, non-binary, queer, questioning, sex assigned at birth, sexual
   orientation, transgender, transgender woman, transgender man and
   transitioning are all listed.

   "This job aid provides guidance to all CBP employees who interact with
   members of the public to help facilitate effective communication with
   the diverse public we serve, including individuals who identify as
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex,
   non-binary, and gender nonconforming (LGBTQI+)," the memo's
   introduction reads, adding that the guidance "should be used by all CBP
   employees."

   It also notes that the terms and definitions "are not universal" and
   that some LGBTQ individuals "may define these terms differently and the
   meanings of the terms may change over time."

   Howell said CBP "should be allowed to do their job and prevent all
   illegal immigration, not used as pawns in some sick social experiment."

   The memo follows an earlier report by Heritage's Oversight Project that
   the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rolled out a similar
   gender pronoun guideline.

   "All employees should be addressed [by] the names and pronouns they use
   to describe themselves," the reported email to HHS employees stated as
   part of its push for "Gender Identity and Non-Discrimination Guidance,"
   which it says protects "employee rights and protections related to
   gender identity."

   Fox News' Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report.
