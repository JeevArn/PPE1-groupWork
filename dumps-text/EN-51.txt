Key Issues in Cultural Heritage
     __________________________________________________________________

About the Series

   Key Issues in Cultural Heritage is a new and unique series which aims
   to identify interdisciplinary debates within the changing and
   under-theorized field of Heritage Studies and to explore how they
   impact on the practices not only of heritage management and
   conservation, but also the processes of production, consumption and
   engagement with heritage in its many and varied forms. Each volume
   brings together a selection of international contributors and global
   case studies, providing a balance of theoretical and empirical content.
