   Physical artifact or intangible attribute of a society inherited from
   past generations

   [300px-Giovanni_Paolo_Pannini_002.jpg] Roman ruins with a prophet, by
   Giovanni Pannini, 1751. The artistic cultural heritage of the Roman
   Empire served as a foundation for later Western culture, particularly
   via the Renaissance and Neoclassicism (as exemplified here).

   Cultural heritage is the heritage of tangible and intangible heritage
   assets of a group or society that is inherited from past generations.
   Not all heritages of past generations are "heritage"; rather, heritage
   is a product of selection by society.^[1]

   Cultural heritage includes tangible culture (such as buildings,
   monuments, landscapes, archive materials, books, works of art, and
   artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language,
   and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant
   landscapes, and biodiversity).^[2] The term is often used in connection
   with issues relating to the protection of indigenous intellectual
   property.^[3]

   The deliberate act of keeping cultural heritage from the present for
   the future is known as preservation (American English) or conservation
   (British English), which cultural and historical ethnic museums and
   cultural centers promote, though these terms may have more specific or
   technical meanings in the same contexts in the other dialect. Preserved
   heritage has become an anchor of the global tourism industry, a major
   contributor of economic value to local communities.^[1]

   Legal protection of cultural property comprises a number of
   international agreements and national laws. United Nations, UNESCO and
   Blue Shield International deal with the protection of cultural
   heritage. This also applies to the integration of United Nations
   peacekeeping.^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7]^[8]^[9]

Types of heritage[edit]

   See also: Indigenous intellectual property

Cultural property[edit]

   See also: Material culture

   Cultural property includes the physical, or "tangible" cultural
   heritage, such as artworks. These are generally split into two groups
   of movable and immovable heritage. Immovable heritage includes
   buildings (which themselves may include installed art such as organs,
   stained glass windows, and frescos), large industrial installations,
   residential projects or other historic places and monuments. Moveable
   heritage includes books, documents, moveable artworks, machines,
   clothing, and other artifacts, that are considered worthy of
   preservation for the future. These include objects significant to the
   archaeology, architecture, science or technology of a specified
   culture.^[2]

   Aspects and disciplines of the preservation and conservation of
   tangible culture include:
     * Museology
     * Archival science
     * Conservation (cultural heritage)
          + Art conservation
          + Archaeological conservation
          + Architectural conservation
          + Film preservation
          + Phonograph record preservation
     * Digital preservation

Intangible culture[edit]

   [220px-Anker_Grossvater_erz%C3%A4hlt_eine_Geschichte_1884.jpg] The
   Grandfather tells a story, by Albert Anker, c. 1884.
   Main article: Intangible cultural heritage
   See also: Cultural expressions

   "Intangible cultural heritage" consists of non-physical aspects of a
   particular culture, more often maintained by social customs during a
   specific period in history. The concept includes the ways and means of
   behavior in a society, and the often formal rules for operating in a
   particular cultural climate. These include social values and
   traditions, customs and practices, aesthetic and spiritual beliefs,
   artistic expression, language and other aspects of human activity. The
   significance of physical artifacts can be interpreted as an act against
   the backdrop of socioeconomic, political, ethnic, religious and
   philosophical values of a particular group of people. Naturally,
   intangible cultural heritage is more difficult to preserve than
   physical objects.^[citation needed]

   Aspects of the preservation and conservation of cultural intangibles
   include:
     * folklore
     * oral history
     * language preservation

Natural heritage[edit]

   See also: Conservation movement

   "Natural heritage" is also an important part of a society's heritage,
   encompassing the countryside and natural environment, including flora
   and fauna, scientifically known as biodiversity, as well as geological
   elements (including mineralogical, geomorphological, paleontological,
   etc.), scientifically known as geodiversity. These kind of heritage
   sites often serve as an important component in a country's tourist
   industry, attracting many visitors from abroad as well as locally.
   Heritage can also include cultural landscapes (natural features that
   may have cultural attributes).

   Aspects of the preservation and conservation of natural heritage
   include:
     * Rare breeds conservation
     * Heirloom plants

  Digital heritage[edit]

   See also: Digital preservation

   Digital heritage is made up of computer-based materials such as texts,
   databases, images, sounds and software being retained for future
   generations.^[10] Digital heritage includes physical objects such as
   documents which have been digitized for retention and artifacts which
   are "born digital", i.e. originally created digitally and having no
   physical form.

Protection of cultural heritage[edit]

  History[edit]

   There have been examples of respect for the cultural assets of enemies
   since ancient times. The roots of today's legal situation for the
   precise protection of cultural heritage also lie in some of Austria's
   ruler Maria Theresa (1717 - 1780) decided Regulations and the demands
   of the Congress of Vienna (1814/15) not to remove works of art from
   their place of origin in the war.^[11] The process continued at the end
   of the 19th century when, in 1874 (in Brussels), at least a draft
   international agreement on the laws and customs of war was agreed. 25
   years later, in 1899, an international peace conference was held in the
   Netherlands on the initiative of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, with the
   aim of revising the declaration (which was never ratified) and adopting
   a convention. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 also significantly
   advanced international law and laid down the principle of the immunity
   of cultural property. Three decades later, in 1935, the preamble to the
   Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions
   (Roerich Pact) was formulated. On the initiative of UNESCO, the Hague
   Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of
   Armed Conflict was signed in 1954.^[12]

   Protection of cultural heritage or protection of cultural goods means
   all measures to protect cultural property against damage, destruction,
   theft, embezzlement or other loss. The term "monument protection" is
   also used for immovable cultural property. This relates in particular
   to the prevention of robbery digs at archaeological sites, the looting
   or destruction of cultural sites and the theft of works of art from
   churches and museums all over the world and basically measures
   regarding the conservation and general access to our common cultural
   heritage. Legal protection of cultural heritage comprises a number of
   international agreements and national laws, and these must also be
   implemented.^[13]^[14]^[15]^[16]^[17]

   There is a close partnership between the UN, United Nations
   peacekeeping, UNESCO, the International Committee of the Red Cross and
   Blue Shield International.^[9]^[18]
   [220px-Blue_Shield_Fact_Finding_Mission_Libyen.jpg] Karl von Habsburg,
   on a Blue Shield International fact-finding mission in Libya

   The protection of the cultural heritage should also preserve the
   particularly sensitive cultural memory, the growing cultural diversity
   and the economic basis of a state, a municipality or a region. Whereby
   there is also a connection between cultural user disruption or cultural
   heritage and the cause of flight. But only through the fundamental
   cooperation, including the military units and the planning staff, with
   the locals can the protection of world heritage sites, archaeological
   finds, exhibits and archaeological sites from destruction, looting and
   robbery be implemented sustainably. The founding president of Blue
   Shield International Karl von Habsburg summed it up with the words:
   "Without the local community and without the local participants, that
   would be completely impossible".^[9]^[19]^[20]^[21]

The ethics and rationale of cultural preservation[edit]

   Objects are a part of the study of human history because they provide a
   concrete basis for ideas, and can validate them. Their preservation
   demonstrates a recognition of the necessity of the past and of the
   things that tell its story.^[22] In The Past is a Foreign Country,
   David Lowenthal observes that preserved objects also validate memories.
   While digital acquisition techniques can provide a technological
   solution that is able to acquire the shape and the appearance of
   artifacts with an unprecedented precision^[23] in human history, the
   actuality of the object, as opposed to a reproduction, draws people in
   and gives them a literal way of touching the past. This poses a danger
   as places and things are damaged by the hands of tourists, the light
   required to display them, and other risks of making an object known and
   available. The reality of this risk reinforces the fact that all
   artifacts are in a constant state of chemical transformation, so that
   what is considered to be preserved is actually changing ‚Äì it is never
   as it once was.^[24] Similarly changing is the value each generation
   may place on the past and on the artifacts that link it to the past.

   The equality or inseparability of cultural preservation and the
   protection of human life has been argued by several agencies and
   writers,^[25] for example former French president Fran√ßois Hollande
   stated in 2016

     Our responsibility is to save lives and also to save the stones --
     there is no choice to be made, because today both are
     destroyed.^[26]

   Kautilya Society in Varanasi - When heritage protection becomes a fight
   for legality and participation [17px-Film-Camera.png] ‚Üí "They harass me
   because I demand civil society participation to public policies and I
   contrast the misuse of privileges"

   Classical civilizations, especially Indian, have attributed supreme
   importance to the preservation of tradition. Its central idea was that
   social institutions, scientific knowledge and technological
   applications need to use a "heritage" as a "resource".^[27] Using
   contemporary language, we could say that ancient Indians considered, as
   social resources, both economic assets (like natural resources and
   their exploitation structure) and factors promoting social integration
   (like institutions for the preservation of knowledge and for the
   maintenance of civil order).^[28] Ethics considered that what had been
   inherited should not be consumed, but should be handed over, possibly
   enriched, to successive generations. This was a moral imperative for
   all, except in the final life stage of sannyasa.

   What one generation considers "cultural heritage" may be rejected by
   the next generation, only to be revived by a subsequent
   generation.^[according to whom?]

World heritage movement[edit]

   [175px-Plaque_Carthage_Unesco.JPG] Plaque stating the designation of
   Carthage as a World Heritage Site.

   Significant was the Convention Concerning the Protection of World
   Cultural and Natural Heritage that was adopted by the General
   Conference of UNESCO in 1972. As of 2011, there are 936 World Heritage
   Sites: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153
   countries. Each of these sites is considered important to the
   international community.

   The underwater cultural heritage is protected by the UNESCO Convention
   on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This convention
   is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection
   of their underwater cultural heritage.^[29]^[30]

   In addition, UNESCO has begun designating masterpieces of the Oral and
   Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The Committee on Economic, Social and
   Cultural Rights sitting as part of the United Nations Economic and
   Social Council with article 15 of its Covenant had sought to instill
   the principles under which cultural heritage is protected as part of a
   basic human right.

   Key international documents and bodies include:
     * Athens Charter, 1931
     * Roerich Pact, 1935
     * Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the
       Event of Armed Conflict, 1954, (with a definition of cultural
       heritage item adopted by some national law)
     * Venice Charter, 1964
     * Barcelona Charter, 2002 (regarding maritime vessel preservation)
     * ICOMOS
     * The Blue Shield, a network of committees of dedicated individuals
       across the world that is "committed to the protection of the
       world's cultural property, and is concerned with the protection of
       cultural and natural heritage, tangible and intangible, in the
       event of armed conflict, natural- or human-made disaster."
     * International Institute for Conservation

   The U.S. Government Accountability Office issued a report describing
   some of the United States' cultural property protection efforts.^[31]

Issues in cultural heritage[edit]

   [100px-Distinctive_emblem_for_cultural_property.svg.png] Emblem used to
   clearly identify cultural property under protection of the Hague
   Convention of 1954, regarding cultural property during armed conflicts.

   Broad philosophical, technical, and political issues and dimensions of
   cultural heritage include:
     * Cultural heritage repatriation
     * Cultural heritage management
     * Cultural property law
     * Heritage tourism
     * Virtual heritage
     * Sustainable preservation
     * Climate change and World Heritage

Management of cultural heritage[edit]

   Issues in cultural heritage management include:
     * Exhibition of cultural heritage objects
     * Radiography of cultural objects
     * Storage of cultural heritage objects
     * Collections maintenance
     * Disaster preparedness

Cultural heritage digital preservation[edit]

   Ancient archaeological artefacts and archaeological sites are naturally
   prone to damage due to their age and environmental conditions. Also,
   there have been tragic occurrences of unexpected human-made disasters,
   such as in the cases of a fire that took place in the 200 years old
   National Museum of Brazil and the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the
   Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

   Therefore, there is a growing need to digitize cultural heritage in
   order to preserve them in the face of potential calamities such as
   climate change, natural disaster, poor policy or inadequate
   infrastructure. For example, the Library of Congress has started to
   digitize its collections in a special program called the National
   Digital Library Program.^[34] The Smithsonian has also been actively
   digitizing its collection with the release of the "Smithsonian X 3D
   Explorer," allowing anyone to engage with the digitized versions of the
   museum's millions of artifacts, of which only two percent are on
   display.^[35]^[36]

   3D scanning devices have become a practical reality in the field of
   heritage preservation. 3D scanners can produce a high-precision digital
   reference model that not only digitizes condition but also provides a
   3D virtual model for replication. The high cost and relative complexity
   of 3D scanning technologies have made it quite impractical for many
   heritage institutions in the past, but this is changing, as technology
   advances and its relative costs are decreasing to reach a level where
   even mobile based scanning applications can be used to create a virtual
   museum.

   There is still a low level of digital archiving of archaeological data
   obtained via excavation,^[37] even in the UK where the lead digital
   archive for archaeology, the Archaeology Data Service, was established
   in the 1990s. Across the globe, countries are at different stages of
   dealing with digital archaeological archives,^[38] all dealing with
   differences in statutory requirements, legal ownership of archives and
   infrastructure.^[39] ^[40]
