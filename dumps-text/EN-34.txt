Key Difference – Ancestry vs Heritage


   Ancestry can simply be defined as the decent or the lineage of a
   person. All  beings on this earth have their own ancestry. When we
   trace back the history, we can think of our ancestors who are great
   grandparents, and we are descendants of their ancestry. On the other
   hand, heritage is the inherited customs, traditions, beliefs,
   monuments, and artifacts from our ancestors. Heritage includes both
   physical objects and intangible things. The key difference between
   ancestry and heritage is that the ancestry is the lineage of the people
   while the heritage is the inheritance from the ancestry. In this
   article, we are going to look at the difference between the terms,
   ancestry and heritage, in more detail.

What is Ancestry?

   Ancestry deals with the people who come before us in our line of
   lineage. One’s parents, grandparents and great grandparents and their
   former generations can be taken as the ancestry of him/her. In
   scientific terms, the people who are responsible for one’s physical
   existence via procreation can be recognized as the ancestry or
   ancestors. Once we trace back the past, we are able to draw a family
   tree based on the ancestry of anybody. Thus, ancestry is genetically
   and generationally inherited. Nobody can change his/her ancestry though
   he or she can hide details.

   Being aware of one’s ancestry is helpful in certain matters, such as
   identifying diseases and certain habits. Also, ancestry adds value to
   one’s personal identity. Ancestry has some connection with one’s
   birthplace because his family members and ancestors might have been
   living there for a long time. But it is not necessary for a person to
   be in the very place that they were born to trace back his ancestry.
   However, it might be useful in order to collect deeper facts about
   one’s ancestors.

What is Heritage?

   Heritage deals with cultural inheritance. Material things, as well as
   non-tangible things, can be inherited via culture. Whatever the things
   we inherit from our ancestors can be considered as heritage. Also,
   peoples’ lifestyles are shaped by heritage. That is, we form our
   behaviors according to the habits, lifestyles, ideas, beliefs, and
   practices, etc., inherited from our culture. Heritage can be seen in
   many forms. Natural resources, such as fauna and flora,
   landscapes, land forms, etc. can be considered as natural heritages.
   Artifacts, paintings, jewelry, clothes, and monuments can be described
   as material heritages. Beliefs, values, traditions, ethics, and morals
   are non-physical features that we’ve  inherited. All these things add
   value to humans as a whole, and we all benefit from those heritages.

   An important fact about heritage is that it could be preserved and
   valued as well as it could be destroyed. We can leave our heritages to
   the future generations also if we want. However, heritage is an
   essential part of our current life.
