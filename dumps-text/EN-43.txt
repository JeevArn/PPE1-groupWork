Collagen: a key to preserving historical parchments

   Whilst we may associate it more with aesthetics than antiquity,
   collagen is central in some cultural heritage objects. Indeed, this
   vital protein is a key structural molecule holding bodily tissues
   together to support cells. And since animal skin was used in centuries
   gone by to make parchments, the pages of many historical documents are
   full of collagen, too.

Collagen, collagen everywhere…

   “There are around 26 different types of collagen, that are found in
   many organs – tendons, skin, cornea, arteries, lungs and so on,” says
   Marie-Claire Schanne-Klein a physicist at École polytechnique. She
   specialises in biophotonics, which essentially means that she uses
   techniques from physics to study living tissues. In her case, she works
   with advanced optical imaging, known as multi-photon microscopy.

   She explains, “we use fluorescent markers in biological samples to
   label different cellular components so we can see them under a
   microscope. But collagen doesn’t need a marker as it naturally
   generates harmonics detected in multi-photon microscopy which makes it
   glow without further intervention on our behalf.” Hence, this protein,
   which creates a ‘fibrillary matrix’ supporting cells, can be observed
   thanks to its harmonic signal. “These intrinsic imaging modalities,
   without any labelling are a speciality of our lab.”

   d’Optique et Biosciences with a medieval manuscript on parchment from
   the Chartres’ library (Photo credit: M. Schmeltz, LOB).

   “Collagen forms fibrils that are arranged differently depending on the
   tissue we are studying,” she clarifies. “In skin, for example, we would
   expect to see tangled bundles of large fibrils, which are responsible
   for its supple texture. Whereas in the cornea collagen fibrils are very
   thin and highly ordered, arranged in layers (or lamellae) that make it
   rigid, giving it the property of focusing light correctly onto the
   retina.” However, collagen may degrade, losing its fibrillar structure
   ultimately, forming a gelatine that no longer generates a harmonic
   signature, but still fluorescence.

   Marie-Claire Schanne-Klein and her colleagues study the collagen
   principally for biomedical purposes. “Collagen structure plays an
   important role in many diseases. It can change in certain extreme
   situations like skin burns or scarring, which leave visible traces. But
   also, in certain cancers because tumours seem to form around structures
   of collagen as a scaffold. We tend to study them for that reason, to
   better understand the pathologies associated to collagen.”

Collagen in cultural heritage

   Interestingly, collagen is found in other places too, including many
   historical manuscripts written on parchments that are made from animal
   skin. Gaël Latour from Université Paris-Saclay studies these materials.
   “Parchments can degrade over time due to storage conditions, and as
   they do so they become increasingly transparent and rigid, leading to
   the loss of the readability of the writing,” he outlines. This
   transparent material is, in fact, degraded collagen, often referred to
   as gelatine.

   “It is common knowledge in the world of cultural heritage that objects
   or documents made from skin will ‘gelatinise’ in this way. And now we
   know that this happens because the collagen fibres in the parchment
   unwind as it degrades, progressively transforming the material into
   gelatine. In doing so, the parchment gradually becomes more
   homogeneous, letting more light through.” Moreover, the process is
   irreversible: once the collagen-to-gelatine process has occurred the
   document is lost forever.

   With his colleagues they have been studying documents used in Western
   Europe in the 13^th Century, at a time before paper, when parchments
   were commonly used. But they have analysed documents that go as far
   back at the 8^th Century. “Remarkably, some of the documents are still
   very well preserved, with just damage at the borders of the pages where
   they have been handled over the hundreds of years since they
   were made.”

   Due to the collagen content of parchment, the team realised that they
   could use multi-photon microscopy to study it. “Currently, the main
   method for testing degradation of parchments is called differential
   scanning calorimetry; it’s a method that requires taking a sample from
   the page that is crushed into a pulp to be tested destroying a part –
   however small – of the document,” he explains. “But if we use
   multi-photon microscopy to study the collagen, we can do this in a
   non-invasive way.” In 2016
   ^1, Latour, Schanne-Klein and colleagues, published a report showing
   that it was possible to see whether a parchment was degraded using
   their technique.

     The researchers show that this method can be used to analyse the
     level of degradation – or ‘gelatinisation’ – of parchments.

   excited fluorescence in red).

Preserving history

   “Initially the idea was to show that we could see degraded collagen in
   the parchments. So, in the beginning the idea was a simple ‘yes’ or
   ‘no’,” he says. “But now, we are seeking to look at how we can quantify
   the amount of degradation. It could help us keep an eye on which
   documents need to be taken care of more effectively or help towards
   restoration efforts.”

   Going further, they recently published another study
   ^2 in which they show that the technique can be used to analyse the
   amount of degradation – or gelatinisation – of parchments. They used
   these techniques to analyse custom documents, then historical ones
   preserved since the 13^th Century from the archives of the Library of
   Chartres, France. In this particular case, over 200 of the documents
   had been exposed to heat from a fire during a bomb raid during World
   War II, resulting in extensive damage and gelatinisation. Gaël Latour
   and his colleagues used these invaluable pages to provide evidence that
   it is possible to quantify the amount degradation using multi-photon
   microscopy, whilst causing them no further harm.

   “Now we want to also understand how the degradation happens,” Gaël
   Latour adds. We have been starting from modern parchments that we have
   artificially degraded. The team expose them to dry conditions and
   temperatures above 100°C as if they were ‘aging’ and then analyse them
   using microscopy to quantify the degradation. Marie-Claire
   Schanne-Klein adds, “normally, gelatine is formed from exposing
   collagenous animal tissue to high temperatures – that’s how gelatine
   used for candy is made, for example, and in the case of these
   documents. But we know that in most cases, the parchments haven’t been
   exposed to such heat. So, in other cases, it is likely the result of
   acidification due to bacterial activity on the documents, which can
   produce an acidic fluid due to humid conditions during storage.” The
   team are setting about studying how this happens in more detail and to
   challenge this hypothesis.

   And they don’t plan on stopping at parchments. “There are many other
   historical objects that contain collagen, too.” Indeed, in museums skin
   can be found in range of materials including rawhide or leather that
   was used to make clothes or in natural history specimens. There are
   other biomolecules that exhibit harmonics, notably cellulosis in
   plants, so that we can analyse old fabrics and musical instruments made
   of wood and more generally a range of other objects – each with their
   own story to tell for years to come.
