What Invisible Solar is

   Invisible Solar is a new PV technology that take on the appearance of

   Each Invisible Solar module is more than a photovoltaic panel, it also
   is an active architectural element with various functionality.

How it works

   A single and indivisible body, with the highest resistance,
   hides and protects the photovoltaic cells inside itself.
   How Invisible Solar works

   Operating of Invisible Solar modules is based on the low molecular
   density. Each module is composed of a non-toxic and recyclable
   polymeric compound we properly developed to encourage the photon
   absorption.
   Inside the module there are incorporated standard monocrystalline
   silicon cells. The surface, that is opaque at the sight but translucent
   to sun rays, allows the light to enter and feed the cells.

Astonishing surfaces

   Terracotta, Stone, Concrete and Wood.
   Invisible Solar is extremely adaptable and can take the appareance of
   main building materials, offering many possible combinations of shapes
   and colors.
   The aesthetic performance of buildings and landscapes is rescued from a
   strong visual impact, through a system able to substitute common
   roofing, covering and flooring elements even on their operation
   features.

Where to install

   Invisible Solar generates all the clean energy
   you need by covering roof, wall and even floor.

   Roofs - To generate energy by covering and protecting your building.
   Walls - Facades covering, garden and patios walling.
   Pavements - Outdoor pavement like driveways, parkings and walkways.
   All together - Merge all the uses for a widespread system.
