Looking to the Future: Global Challenges to Cultural Heritage Preservation

   March 03, 2021 | by Jonathan S. Bell, Ph.D.
   View of the Alhambra from a distance, 2011

   In this article from World Monuments Fund's 2021 Watch Magazine, WMF
   Vice President of Programs Jonathan Bell takes stock of our cumulative
   impact over these past five and a half decades and considers how best
   to enhance our efforts protecting and supporting the world’s most
   incredible cultural landscapes, architectural marvels, and places of
   shared significance.

   After decades working to underscore, preserve, and rehabilitate key
   cultural heritage in countries around the world from Albania to
   Zimbabwe, our commitment to our planet’s monuments of cultural
   expression and human ingenuity is as strong as ever. We must, however,
   recognize that the global challenges facing the cultural heritage we
   endeavor to protect have changed and created a new landscape across
   which World Monuments Fund must operate and demonstrate relevance. The
   global pandemic that has plagued the world through most of 2020 has
   drastically changed the way we all work and play.

   Since the international recognition of the novel coronavirus at the
   beginning of this year, we have witnessed unprecedented changes to the
   interactions between people and places of significance. With fewer
   visits to historic buildings and archaeological sites resulting in a
   dramatic loss of revenue for these places and their adjacent
   communities, the critical link between tourism and local economies has
   become painfully apparent. At the same time, significantly diminished
   travel and sparse crowds have led the way to cleaner air and waterways,
   welcomed frolicking wildlife into the world’s urban centers, and
   replenished the sense of place and idyllic beauty once enjoyed by local
   residents without the canopy of mass tourism.

   Amid the throes of this pandemic, continued police violence toward
   people of color in the United States and the effective organizing of
   the Black Lives Matter movement sparked an unprecedented worldwide
   recognition of painful histories embodied in the statues and monuments
   erected in public squares and before town halls around the world.
   Spurred on by social media networks and covered by traditional media,
   the groundswell call to remove these monuments associated with historic
   injustice has helped showcase that celebrated heritage often represents
   privilege. Some stories are told in stone and bronze for the world to
   see, but many others lack recognition and remain unseen and unheard.

   While our relationships with our cultural heritage evolved over the
   past year, changing rainfall patterns, intensifying storms, and rising
   temperatures continued to pose challenges. The pervasive nature of
   climate change means that no building, landscape, archaeological site,
   or adjacent community is spared the need to adapt and develop solutions
   to this invisible and unpredictable force. Tied to changing weather
   patterns is an increase in disasters from flooding, sustained high
   winds, unusual temperature extremes, and drought, all of which present
   distinct challenges for the places and communities where World
   Monuments Fund works.

   As we consider the events of this past year and our priorities for the
   future, we recognize that World Monuments Fund must act as an agent of
   change. We remain committed to working with local partners and
   communities to protect the world’s most important places; this is our
   mission. Additionally, we must ensure our impact is not only measured
   in finished projects, but in the cumulative effect of outcomes on some
   of the world’s most pressing challenges. By curating our portfolio of
   projects such that multiple places can develop viable mitigation and
   adaptation strategies to similar challenges and threats, World
   Monuments Fund can employ a multiplier effect that has widespread and
   lasting impact.

   To this end, we have identified three global challenges that will help
   shape our portfolio of projects, focus our resources, and coalesce our
   individual efforts into far-reaching solutions. By helping partners
   develop sound local and regional tourism strategies, we will work to
   mitigate the negative impacts and harness the economic and social
   potential of imbalanced tourism. In strengthening our commitment to
   work with unrecognized heritage places and integrate diverse
   perspectives, we will bolster the role of underrepresented heritage in
   global discussions and preservation decision-making. Through developing
   site-specific solutions to changing weather patterns, we will
   underscore the threat that climate change represents and contribute to
   adaptation strategies around the world.

Imbalanced Tourism

   The adage that “tourism is a doubleedged sword” is well known to
   preservation professionals, since the field has long struggled to
   promote patterns of visitation that can sustainably support heritage
   places with adequate revenue and minimally impact the physical fabric
   or sense of place. As many of us have experienced, popular destinations
   are quickly overrun and the visitor experience significantly diminished
   by large crowds that leave their mark on the monuments, exasperate the
   local community, and support the local economy with mixed results. For
   some places, the promised economic development never comes, as visitors
   are few or inconsistent and revenue may be funneled to external
   entities or local powerbrokers through prepaid packages and foreign
   tour operators. At other locations, tourism leads to rampant growth
   that gentrifies neighborhoods, encourages new development, and forever
   changes the composition of local communities and the character of the
   heritage.

   One strategy lies in developing and coordinating a wide array of
   visitation opportunities at a regional scale, as opposed to focusing on
   individual sites. Such an approach requires working closely with local
   and regional authorities, resident communities, and site managers to
   coordinate decisionmaking and tourism promotion. World Monuments Fund
   is developing this approach at 2020 World Monuments Watch sites
   Bennerley Viaduct (UK) and Canal Nacional (Mexico), working closely
   with local community-based organizations to enhance and highlight
   incredible infrastructure that shapes the landscape and provides a wide
   variety of recreation and tourism opportunities. In the Jewish Mahalla
   of Bukhara (Uzbekistan) and the historic neighborhood of Axerquía in
   Córdoba (Spain), a similar approach at the neighborhood levels will
   help strengthen interest in and visitation of traditional houses and
   streetscapes that epitomize the local vernacular architecture and
   culture.

   Another tactic that has flourished throughout the pandemic is digital
   tourism—experiencing the world’s cultural treasures from the comfort of
   your own home through the marvel of technology. World Monuments Fund is
   integrating digital documentation and the development of virtual
   experiences to raise awareness about the places we work and share the
   wonder and rich history with a broad audience. We have already
   developed interactive online experiences for places like San Pedro
   Apóstol de Andahuaylillas (Peru), as well as an award-winning virtual
   visit to La Garma cave (Spain). This approach not only allows larger
   numbers of people to “visit” these incredible places, but contributes
   to their protection by preventing high-volume tourism that could be
   detrimental to their survival. Altogether, these approaches support the
   development of a more sustainable tourism that not only bolsters
   destinations and resident communities, but also provides for a richer
   and more fulfilling visitor experience. World Monuments Fund will
   continue to work closely with our partners and stakeholders on the
   ground to develop viable visitor management strategies that distribute
   tourism at a regional scale and help reach new audiences and supporters
   of cultural heritage. A commitment to balanced tourism enhances our
   efforts to support the places we work.

Underrepresented Heritage

   As the debate over monuments this year has clearly demonstrated, power
   and privilege are often tied to celebrated cultural heritage. The
   architectural marvels of the past that regale throngs of visitors with
   stories of pageantry and conquest frequently embody rarely recounted
   stories of servitude, subjugation, and exclusion. These are the stories
   of the disempowered communities whose land was stolen, who labored as
   enslaved people, or who paid oppressive taxes to fund the opulence and
   splendor of many feted destinations. The artistic achievement is
   lauded, but the associated sacrifice is often ignored. Despite recent
   efforts at historic sites to interpret these stories and provide a
   richer narrative, diverse perspectives and stories of injustice are
   rarely integrated. Moreover, there are many places of significance that
   do not appear on any sanctioned list and lack broad support for
   protection because they have been sidelined for generations. These
   heritage places hold incredible importance for the communities that
   value them and often represent unique facets of human ingenuity,
   creativity, and artistry that are otherwise unrecognized. Their demise
   would be an irrevocable loss for humanity.

   Encouraging inclusion of diverse perspectives and narratives is a
   crucial path forward to recognizing and protecting humanity’s rich
   heritage. The most iconic historic places comprise countless unheard
   stories and unrecognized contributions by disenfranchised communities.
   World Monuments Fund renews our commitment to the heritage of
   underrepresented groups exemplified through previous work in Essaouira
   (Morocco) and with Voices of Alabama (United States). In these
   projects, the narratives of minority communities were recorded and
   disseminated to raise awareness of the significant role their heritage
   plays in local identity. Current projects at the Woolworth Building in
   San Antonio (United States) and the Mam Rashan Shrine in Sinjar (Iraq)
   underscore the wealth and distinctiveness of so many underrepresented
   heritage sites and the threats they face, ranging from lack of
   recognition to targeted destruction associated with genocide.

   World Monuments Fund will continue to engage a wide variety of
   stakeholders and capture divergent perspectives as an essential
   component of our work. Through close collaboration with local
   communities, we commit to highlighting the wonder of humanity’s rich
   accomplishments while denouncing past and current injustice. Ensuring
   that recognized cultural heritage embodies our diversity and portrays
   the complexities of history enhances its relevance for communities
   everywhere.

Climate Change

   Our built heritage has always contended with the elements. Crucial
   components of local architecture, sense of place, and even cultural
   mores have developed over centuries in response to climate. In recent
   years, we have seen weather patterns change around the globe such that
   temperatures are shifting, sea levels are rising, and storms are
   intensifying. Communities and the places of importance that help
   nourish them must adapt to survive. Despite the concept of the monument
   as a beacon for the ages, extreme temperatures, violent winds, and
   excessive or inadequate rainfall represent new threats to their
   longevity. Year after year, increased flooding and wildfires damage and
   even destroy historic sites in countless nations around the world. The
   global nature of our changing climate underscores the need for
   pragmatic, replicable strategies to safeguard our cultural heritage.

   A principal approach lies in the development of adaptation strategies
   that provide historic and cultural resources with the ability to
   withstand climatic changes: shed and drain larger volumes of water;
   withstand stronger winds; tolerate more extreme temperatures; and
   endure drought. In many cases, traditional natural resource management
   and building techniques already provide the answers and simply require
   renewal and strengthening. World Monuments Fund’s past projects in
   Kilwa (Tanzania) and current project at a 2020 Watch site in
   Vijayapura, Karnataka (India), integrate rehabilitation of traditional
   land and water management systems as a strategy to protect and
   revitalize the historic sites. In other cases, such as Wat
   Chaiwatthanaram (Thailand), modern engineering solutions and drainage
   plans have been implemented to protect this Buddhist temple complex
   from flood events exacerbated by a changing climate.

   Cultural heritage is also emblematic of the urgency of climate
   change—iconic places are dramatically swallowed by the sea or destroyed
   by gale force winds. Places of importance can serve as rallying cries
   for global coordination and commitment to the climate crisis. With our
   projects at Blackpool Piers (United Kingdom) and the Coral Stone
   Mosques (Maldives), World Monuments Fund has aimed to highlight the
   plight of our heritage in the face of climate change and work closely
   with local stakeholders and international institutions to develop
   strategies to save them.

   We have the duty to protect the world’s cultural heritage from the
   immediate effects of climate change and the opportunity to emphasize
   the need for action through work at these places. World Monuments Fund
   is committed to playing a key role in both arenas, working closely with
   local and international partners to find solutions to immediate needs
   and to contribute to long-term mitigation. Our approach is to learn
   from our work and disseminate the lessons of successful strategies and
   failed tactics alike to improve our global capacity to safeguard our
   places of greatest significance and the communities that turn to them
   for affirmation, solace, and the promise of cultural resilience.
