Word History

   Etymology

   Middle English heritage, eritage, borrowed from Anglo-French, from
   heriter "to inherit, make an heir" (going back to Late Latin hērēditāre
   "to leave as an inheritance, inherit, make an heir," from Latin hērēd-,
   hērēs heir entry 1 + -itāre, verb suffix) + -age -age

   Note: The Latin verb suffix -itāre normally has repetitive or
   frequentative value (cf. hesitate, meditate, palpitate), not factitive
   or causative value, so in this instance it may be of distinct origin. A
   possible model is the adjective hērēditārius (see hereditary), in the
   formation of which a stem hērēdit- appears to have been extracted from
   the noun hērēditāt-, hērēditās "succession to an heir, inheritance," by
   construing the suffix as -āt-, -ās (or, alternatively, *hērēditātārius
   was shortened by haplology to hērēditārius).
   First Known Use
