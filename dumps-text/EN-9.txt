Christmas heritage runs deep for the grand marshal of this year's Destin
parade
     __________________________________________________________________

   Tina Harbuck   The Destin Log

   He’s been in the Destin Christmas parade many times, but never at the
   front.

   This year, however, Cyron Marler, a Destin native, will serve as grand
   marshal of the 37^th annual Destin Christmas Parade, “A Christmas
   Vacation” on Dec. 9.

   “It’s a great honor,” the 66-year-old said from his home on Second
   Street.

   “There’s been a long line of people that I’ve known for a long time,
   that deserve it. But I’m honored to be able to do it this year,” Marler
   said.

   The parade will roll out at 10 a.m. on Dec. 9 down Harbor Boulevard
   (U.S. 98) from Beach Drive to Stahlman Avenue.

Marler has fond memories of Christmas in Destin

   As a youngster, they would celebrate at Destin Elementary School on
   Christmas Eve, he said.

   "The children would meet and Santa Clause would come out and give us a
   small toy and a bag of fruit and candy. Then we’d go to church services
   and then come back home and wait for Santa to come the next morning,”
   he said.

   “Most of them have all been great,” Marler said of Christmases past.

   He recalled having fish fries to help raise money for toys.

   “We did that for years,” he said.

   “But then Destin got too big … too much other stuff going on,” he said,
   noting the city had started doing the Christmas Tree Lighting ceremony
   at the community center.

   What to know The Destin Christmas parade and boat parade

   As for his favorite Christmas gift, he said he got a lot of different
   things as a youth.

   “Whatever was the hot thing … Hot Wheels or Legos. We also got bicycles
   and tricycles,” he said.

   “Mom and dad always got us something that my sister and I could do
   together.” he said. One year they got a tent and another lawn darts.

   “It was something we could do as a family … or something that our
   cousins could join in,” he said.

Marler's Christmas heritage runs deep in Destin

   His great grandfather William T. Marler, known as “Uncle Billy,” served
   as Santa Claus in the early days. William Elisha Marler, father to
   “Uncle Billy” started the community Christmas event in 1915 and played
   Santa until passing it down to “Uncle Billy,” who continued the
   tradition until he died in September 1960.

   Cyron Marler has been very much involved with Christmas in Destin over
   the years.

   He served as emcee for the Holiday Boat Parade and the tree lighting
   ceremony at the Destin Community Center.

   “I’m going to miss doing those,” he said.

   He has also been a member of Village Baptist for more than two decades,
   where he sang in the choir and on the praise team.

Marler's service to the city

   Marler has served on the Destin city council 16 years, but not
   consecutive. His first term was in 2000, second in 2004 and then again
   in 2008. He skipped a couple of years and was again elected in 2012,
   2016 and then termed out in 2020.

   Before he was elected to council he served on various committees, such
   as the Public Works Committee and later the Board of Adjustments.

   “I had to resign due to my health,” Marler said.

   Marler who suffers from Parkinson's, has since retired from his job of
   18 years with Legendary as a maintenance technician.

Marler at the helm

   As for being grand marshal, Marler said he’s looking forward to it.

   “I’ve been watching it or being in it for many years,” Marler said,
   noting he’s been in it as part of church or work.

   “It’s going to be different to be at the head of the line,” he said.

   Marler said he misses the old days of simpler times.

   But he’s still ready to roll with the parade.

   “As long as people remember what Christmas is supposed to be all about,
   we’ll be ok. Jesus is the reason for the season,” he said.

Junior marshals to follow

   In addition to Marler as grand marshal, the parade committee didn’t
   want to neglect the accomplishments of two Destin Little League teams
   that made it to the state tournament this year in their divisions.
   Thus, the U10 Destin All Star softball team and U12 Destin All Star
   baseball team will serve as “junior marshals” at this year's parade.

   Members of the softball team include Emery Romeo, Abreigh Solano, Addie
   Gordon, Adley Phillips, Caroline Spears, CK Carter, Harper Wood, Layla
   Austin, Nora Baumeister, Olive Shaffer, Reese Blankenship, Savannah
   Amos and Stella O’Neal. Coaches were Amber Romeo, BJ Wood and Gabriel
   Solano.

   Members of the baseball team include Gavin Douglas, Graham Herndon,
   Hunter Ray, James Espy, Jax O’Dell, Kingston Dey, Landon Fagan, Logan
   Connick, Luke Horin, Bentlee Bailey, Case Culhane and Colton Romeo.
   Coaches were Tony Bailey, Justin Ray and Shane O’Dell.
