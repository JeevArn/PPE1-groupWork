Ph.D. in Informatics

Take your knowledge to the next level with a Ph.D. in Informatics

   As an informatics Ph.D. student, you’ll conduct practical and
   theoretical research into areas such as complex networks and systems,
   human-computer interaction design, and virtual heritage. When you’ve
   earned your degree, you’ll have the knowledge and skills you need to
   become a leader in academia, government, industry, or the nonprofit
   sector.

Pick your specialization

   While you’re doing your Ph.D. research, you’ll work in several
   disciplines, but you’ll also choose an area, or track, in which to
   specialize.
     * Animal Informatics
     * Bioinformatics
     * Complex Networks and Systems
     * Computing, Culture, and Society
     * Human-Computer Interaction/Design
     * Health Informatics
     * Intelligent and Interactive Systems
     * Security Informatics
     * Virtual Heritage

Choose a minor

   All Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering doctoral
   students are required to complete either a minor within the school or
