   EAST LIVERPOOL — The United Way’s Hungry Bowl fundraising event held in
   conjunction with Heritage Environmental Services to raise money for
   three area agencies supported by United Way had a low turnout last
   week.

   Raymond Wayne, Heritage Thermal, didn’t know whether to attribute the
   low turnout to unseasonably warm weather or other area fundraisers
   being held on the same night.

   The event held at the East Liverpool Salvation Army served for $10 a
   soup kitchen style meal consisting of homemade soups made by United Way
   board members and Heritage Thermal employees and served by staff of
   Heritage Environmental Services along with a bottle of water, a dinner
   roll and cookies to approximately 40 people.

   The event also featured a Chinese auction, with baskets donated by
   Columbiana County commissioners, Heritage Thermal employees and the
   board members for the United Way of Southern Columbiana, which brought
   in approximately $1,000, according to Karen Montgomery, Heritage
   Environmental Services/Heritage Thermal.

   Montgomery noted that the Columbiana County commissioners and Heritage
   Thermal each donated $2,500, bringing the total raised for the event to
   just under $6,000.

   Last year, the fundraiser brought in over $8,000 with many more tickets
   being sold.

   The money raised will be divided among Family & Community Service,
   Community Resource Center and the Salvation Army and will be used by
   each agency to stock their food pantries.

   Those who attended the fundraiser were asked to bring a food donation
   with them. The donated canned goods were given to the Salvation Army
   and some of the perishable leftovers were given to Catholic Charities
   for use in their meal delivery program, Montgomery said.

   “These are just a few of the nine local agencies the United Way of
   Southern Columbiana County supports,” she noted.

   “The United Way would like to thank HTS (Heritage Thermal) employees
   for donating auction items, making soups and assisting at the event,”
   Montgomery said. “A big thank you to those in the community that
   supported the fundraiser by donating or attending. Together we change
   lives and impact communities.”
