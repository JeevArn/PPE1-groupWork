LLM Concentration

   Main Content

   To earn t​he LLM in International Law, a student must complete 24
   semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative grade point average
   (GPA) of 2.0. A summer term is counted as a semester for this purpose.
   Students who complete 24 credit hours with a GPA below the 2.0 GPA
   required to earn the degree will not be permitted to continue taking
   classes to improve their GPA. A student is automatically dismissed if
   he or she has a cumulative GPA below 2.0 for any three consecutive
   semesters.

   The LLM program may be completed on either a full- or part-time basis
   but it must be completed within five years. With the exception of
   students admitted to and enrolled in the joint JD/LLM program, credits
   earned as part of the JD program do not count toward the LLM degree. In
   addition, no credit is given for law courses taken before a student is
   admitted to and enrolled in the LLM program.

   As part of the International Law LLM degree program, DePaul's LLM
   concentration in international cultural heritage law provides extensive
   coursework and unique cross-curricular offerings to attorneys
   interested in expanding their training in this field.

   For additional information on our LLM program, please visit our degree
   requirements page along with a full list of required and elective
   courses for the International Cultural Heritage Law Concentration.​
