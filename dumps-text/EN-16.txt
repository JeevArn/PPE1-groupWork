Spotlight: COVID-19 virus not created in lab, say French experts

   PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- French experts have refuted the claim by
   their colleague and Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luc Montagnier that
   the novel coronavirus causing the COVID-19 pandemic has been engineered
   and contains some genes of HIV-1.

   Montagnier last week told the French CNews channel: "There was
   manipulation around this virus ... the coronavirus of the bat, someone
   added sequences, in particular of HIV, the virus of AIDS ... It is not
   natural. It's the work of professionals, of molecular biologists ... A
   very meticulous work."

   The French virologist won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2008 for his
   discovery of the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV).

   The hypothesis that a virus was created in a laboratory in Wuhan
   sounded "a conspiracy vision that does not relate to the real science,"
   said Jean-Francois Delfraissy, an immunologist and head of the
   scientific council that advises the French government on the COVID-19
   pandemic, when interviewed by French television BFM TV.

   "Everyone in the scientific community agrees that COVID-19 is a
   coronavirus. From time to time there are coronaviruses different from
   the others, as are SARS and MERS with a pathogenicity which has
   appeared," he added.

   Both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East
   Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are caused by coronaviruses, and the
   COVID-19 virus is also known as SARS-CoV-2.

   "The world of viruses is a world in perpetual evolution," said
   Delfraissy, who is also president of France's National Consultative
   Ethics Committee for health and life sciences. "I rather think that
   COVID-19 is a coronavirus which had an animal reservoir and passed into
   humans for reasons that are not well known yet."

   For Olivier Schwartz, head of the virus and immunity department of
   France's Pasteur Institute, studies on the virus's genes show clearly
   that it was not a virus made by human beings in the laboratory.

   "Professor Montagnier spreads whimsical theories," he told the French
   weekly L'Obs, previously known as Le Nouvel Observateur.

   "Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, was not
   created in the laboratory. We see this by studying the genetic heritage
   of the virus, which has been sequenced by Chinese teams and then
   verified in many other laboratories, including the Pasteur Institute,
   which was the first in Europe to do so," said Schwartz.

   "This virus is clearly part of the coronavirus family tree. It is close
   to Sars-CoV-1, with which it has 80 percent homology," he explained.

   "Above all, the same virus is found in different animals, in particular
   the pangolin and the bat. And there, the percentage of similarities is
   greater than 95 percent. So, by drawing up the family tree of this
   virus, we know that it is derived from viruses that circulate in
   nature," he said.

   What Montagnier spreads is "fake news" that started in March with a
   manuscript posted by an Indian team on a website where scientists share
   ongoing analyses without waiting for expert verification, added
   Schwartz.

   "The Indian team ended up withdrawing their manuscript. My personal
   opinion is that these Indian researchers were in good faith at the
   outset in their desire to analyze the genome of the virus, and they
   realized their error later. But Professor Montagnier has taken up a
   whimsical theory," he said. Enditem
