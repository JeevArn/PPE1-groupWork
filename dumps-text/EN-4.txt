2021: A Most Successful Year for Heritage Family

   Heritage Family of Elizabethton, Tennessee completed its most
   successful year in the history of the company in 2021.

   Richard Tetrick of Heritage Family stated, “2021 was the most
   successful year in the history of our company.  Not only did we serve
   more families than any year before 2021, we entered or expanded our
   presence in seven different strategic markets with the addition of 27
   locations.  In 2021 we added 20 new funeral homes, four affordable
   cremation facilities, two cemeteries and one pet cremation business.
   We are extremely proud to be associated with these additional high
   quality partners for Heritage.  We are equally proud of our at-need and
   pre-need staff who continually went the extra mile to serve families in
   this pandemic environment.”

   March of 2021 saw the company expanding its operation in the Cleveland
   OH market with the addition of Bodnar-Mahoney Funeral Home and All-Ohio
   Cremation Burial and Cremation Society.

   In July, the Craig Kempf Funeral Homes with four locations in the
   Battle Creek, MI  area became members of the Heritage Family.

   The company entered the Louisville, KY market in August with the
   purchase of the well-respected Pearson Funeral Home.

   In September Heritage Family expanded its presence in the Tri-Cities,
   Tennessee region with the addition of the Akard Funeral Home in
   Bristol, TN.  The Akard acquisition compliments our two other funeral
   homes in the Bristol market, as well as our fifteen other properties in
   the Tri-Cities area.

   September also saw the company expanding its presence in the high
   growth metropolitan Atlanta area with purchase of the Cannon Cleveland
   Funeral Directors, Southern Crescent Crematorium and Companion Care
   Cremation Services in McDonough, GA.

   The company entered the Omaha, NE market in December of 2021 with the
   addition of the four locations of John A Gentleman Mortuaries, a
   leading funeral home company in Omaha and also the Arbor Cremation
   Society of Omaha.

   Brentwood Funeral Services of Memphis, TN became a member of Heritage
   Family in December of 2021.  Brentwood consisted of seven funeral homes
   in the Memphis metro area, two cemeteries and a mortuary service
   company in Jackson, MS.

   The company plans to continue its growth in 2022 by acquisition as well
   as organic growth.  At the present time the company has letters of
   intent to acquire seven funeral homes and one cremation business with
   the transactions closing in the first and second quarters of 2022.
   Heritage Family anticipates serving over 14,000 families through its’
   existing funeral homes and cemeteries in 2022.

   Heritage Family operates in ten states with 69 locations consisting of
   52 funeral homes, ten cemeteries, five low-cost cremation facilities
   and two pet cremation businesses.
