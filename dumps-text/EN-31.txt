What is Cultural Heritage?

   We often hear about the importance of cultural heritage. But what is
   cultural heritage? And whose heritage is it? Whose national heritage,
   for example, does the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci belong to? Is it
   French or Italian?
   First of all, let’s have a look at the meaning of the words. “Heritage”
   is a property, something that is inherited, passed down from previous
   generations. In the case of “cultural heritage,” the heritage doesn’t
   consist of money or property, but of culture, values, and traditions.
   Cultural heritage implies a shared bond, our belonging to a community.
   It represents our history and our identity; our bond to the past, to
   our present, and the future.

   1539–40 C.E., Tabriz, Kashan, Isfahan or Kirman, Iran (Victoria and
   Albert Museum)

Tangible and intangible cultural heritage

   Cultural heritage often brings to mind artifacts (paintings, drawings,
   prints, mosaics, sculptures), historical monuments and buildings, as
   well as archaeological sites. But the concept of cultural heritage is
   even wider than that, and has gradually grown to include all evidence
   of human creativity and expression: photographs, documents, books and
   manuscripts, and instruments, etc. either as individual objects or as
   collections. Today, towns, underwater heritage, and the natural
   environment are also considered part of cultural heritage since
   communities identify themselves with the natural landscape.
   Moreover, cultural heritage is not only limited to material objects
   that we can see and touch. It also consists of immaterial elements:
   traditions, oral history, performing arts, social practices,
   traditional craftsmanship, representations, rituals, knowledge, and
   skills transmitted from generation to generation within a community.
   Intangible heritage, therefore, includes a dizzying array of
   traditions, music, and dances such as tango and flamenco, holy
   processions, carnivals, falconry, Viennese coffee house culture, the
   Azerbaijani carpet and its weaving traditions, Chinese shadow puppetry,
   the Mediterranean diet, Vedic chanting,
   (BUTTON) Kabuki theatre
   , the polyphonic singing of the Aka of Central Africa (to name a few
   examples).

The importance of protecting cultural heritage

   But cultural heritage is not just a set of cultural objects or
   traditions from the past. It is also the result of a selection process:
   a process of memory and oblivion that characterizes every human society
   constantly engaged in choosing—for both cultural and political
   reasons—what is worthy of being preserved for future generations and
   what is not.
   All peoples make their contribution to the culture of the world. That’s
   why it’s important to respect and safeguard all cultural heritage,
   through national laws and international treaties. Illicit trafficking
   of artifacts and cultural objects, pillaging of archaeological sites,
   and destruction of historical buildings and monuments cause irreparable
   damage to the cultural heritage of a country. UNESCO (United Nations
   Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), founded in 1954,
   has adopted international conventions on the protection of cultural
   heritage, to foster intercultural understanding while stressing the
   importance of international cooperation.
   The protection of cultural property is an old problem. One of the most
   frequently recurring issues in protecting cultural heritage is the
   difficult relationship between the interests of the individual and the
   community, the balance between private and public rights.
   Ancient Romans established that a work of art could be considered part
   of the patrimony of the whole community, even if privately owned. For
   example, sculptures decorating the façade of a private building were
   recognized as having a common value and couldn’t be removed, since they
   stood in a public site, where they could be seen by all citizens.

   Museums)
   In his Naturalis Historia, the Roman author Pliny the Elder (23–79
   C.E.) reported that the statesman and general
   (BUTTON) Agrippa
   placed the Apoxyomenos, a masterpiece by the very famous Greek sculptor
   Lysippos, in front of his thermal baths. The statue represented an
   athlete scraping dust, sweat, and oil from his body with a particular
   instrument called a “strigil, or scraper. Emperor
   (BUTTON) Tiberius
   deeply admired the sculpture and ordered it be removed from public view
   and placed in his private palace. The Roman people rose up and obliged
   him to return the Apoxyomenos to its previous location, where everyone
   could admire it.
   Our right to enjoy the arts, and to participate in the cultural life of
   the community is included in the United Nation’s 1948 Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights. [1]

Whose cultural heritage?

   The term “cultural heritage” typically conjures up the idea of a single
   society and the communication between its members. But cultural
   boundaries are not necessarily well-defined. Artists, writers,
   scientists, craftsmen, and musicians learn from each other, even if
   they belong to different cultures, far removed in space or time. Just
   think about the influence of Japanese prints on Paul Gauguin’s
   paintings; or of African masks on Pablo Picasso’s works. Or you could
   also think of western architecture in Liberian homes in Africa. When
   some of the freed African-American enslaved people went back to their
   homeland*, they built homes inspired by the neoclassical style of
   mansions on American plantations. American neoclassical style was in
   turn influenced by the Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, who had
   been influenced by Roman and Greek architecture.
   Let’s take another example, that of the Mona Lisa painted in the early
   sixteenth century by Leonardo da Vinci, and displayed at the Musée du
   Louvre in Paris. From a modern point of view, whose national heritage
   does the Mona Lisa belong to?

   People taking photos of the Mona Lisa (photo: Heather Anne Campbell, CC
   BY-NC-ND 2.0)
   Leonardo was a very famous Italian painter, that’s why the Mona Lisa is
   obviously part of the Italian cultural heritage. When Leonardo went to
   France, to work at
   (BUTTON) King Francis I
   ’s court, he probably brought the Mona Lisa with him. It seems that in
   1518 King Francis I acquired the Mona Lisa, which therefore ended up in
   the royal collections: that’s why it is obviously part of the French
   national heritage, too. This painting has been defined as the best
   known, the most visited, the most written about, and the most parodied
   work of art in the world: as such, it belongs to the cultural heritage
   of all mankind.
   Cultural heritage passed down to us from our parents must be preserved
   for the benefit of all. In an era of globalization, cultural heritage
   helps us to remember our cultural diversity, and its understanding
   develops mutual respect and renewed dialogue amongst different
   cultures.

   [1] See Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

       I enjoy and support the culture of all peoples, but I have a
       conflict when it comes to acquiring artifacts for my own pleasure -
       it feels like I am robbing or faking the enjoyment as my own. An
       example is the jewelry made by our Native Americans. Made of
       feathers and natural elements, I don't feel right wearing it since
       it is not part of my culture (I'm German). Silly , I know, but I
       wish to be respectful.

            If you bought this jewelry new in a shop that features Native
            artists, it was made to be worn by anyone, which includes you
            (and when people ask you about it, tell them where they can
            buy it; artists need to eat).

       In the final paragraph Elena Franchi said "Cultrual heritage passed
       down to us from our parents must be preserved" that profoundly
       resonated deeply in my spirit. Why? Because generations of culture,
       family heritage and ancient religious practices are lost to
       generations through the tearing down of of old churches, and
       abandonment of schools and public buildings. ALOT OF THESE PLACES
       HAVE PAINTINGS AND CARVINGS RIGHT ON THE STRUCTURE...what happens

       Where does cultural appropriation play into this discussion of
       cultural heritage? This is something that has often been discussed
       about Pablo Picasso's work that was inspired by African masks. It
       is one thing to be inspired, but where is the line drawn between
       being inspired to appropriating artistic styles that are not your
       own? If cultural heritage is something that should be preserved for
       us all, does this mean we all have the right to take inspiration
       from whatever is not our own culture? If so, is this okay as long
       as we acknowledge it as something that is not our own?

            The way I see, Culture is a way of life. Or more accurately
            how you live your life. Cultural heritage is a way to catalog
            how the past ways of life flow into what they have become
            today. So yes cultural heritage is a form of history. But
            rather then focusing on dates and facts, cultural heritage
            focuses on intellectual and spiritual humanity.

            Cultural Heritage is the sum total of various influences on an
            individual, as of a particular point in time, that influences
            that person to voice their thoughts, opinions and ideas to
            others. Culture over time can and will change as new ideas are

       seriously! If people as You can assist and suppport our vision in

            Although Leonardo da Vinci painted The Mona Lisa between 1503
            and 1506, it didn't become famous in 1911 when it became
            missing. A former employee of the Louvre Museum, Vincenzo
            Peruggia, and his helpers stole the painting. Peruggia hid the
            painting in his apartment for 2 years. But when he tried to
            sell it to an art gallery in Florence, Italy, he was arrested.
            When the Mona Lisa was missing, a lot of hype was created by
            the media and the authorities. So when it was returned, over
            100,000 people went to see it. Then the Louvre featured it as
            one of its main attractions. It formerly was just another
            less-known painting. Overtime, various kinds of experts began
            to focus on it too. So this is probably the primary reason it
            became famous.

       What about the spoils of war? For example, the marbles from
       Parthenon and many more Greek statues are displayed in London,
       still not returned to Greece.
       Many pieces of art are displayed in museums all around the world as
       a result of looting during times of war.Is it morally correct to
       deprive pieces of history and culture from a now peaceful nation?

            i agree. a LOT of egyptian history was taken by force from its
            country, and it still has not been returned. england needs to
            return ALL of the relics and art back to their original
            countries.

       Will the Mona Lisa be known as part of the Italian cultural
       heritage or France? Because even though it's made in France,
       Leanardo was a famous ITALIAN painter.

            The Mona Lisa is neither French nor Italian, it is from a time
            and culture before Italy, as a political state, even existed.
            Since the painter, Leonardo, was a homosexual, you might just
            as easily say that is part of Gay cultural heritage.

            There are people in this world who think that their smile is
            unattractive. There are people in this world who think
            themselves to be unattractive, and don't like cameras pointed
            at them. There are people in this world who believe that a
            camera takes more than a visual image, but also subtracts a
            little bit of their being.
